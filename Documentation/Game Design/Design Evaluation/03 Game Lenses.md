# Game Lenses

<!-- Use this document to outline what are game lenses and which are there, are there any with higher priority for us etc. -->

This is a list of all the Game Lenses that are listed on this website: [Art Of Game Design](https://deck.artofgamedesign.com/#/?lang=en).
Each one of those was taken into consideration and put into three groups depending on of how much use they are to us.

### Yes
2. [2] Lens of Essential Experience (What experience do I want the player to have? What is essential to the experience and how can my game capture this experience?)
5. [5] Lense of Fun (What parts of my game are fun? What parts need to be more fun?)
21. [21] Lense of Flow (Does my game have clear goals? Does my game provide a steady stream of gradually increasing challenges? Are the player's skill improving as expected?)
34. [34] Lense of Skill (What skills does my game require from the player? Are some players much better at these skills than others? Can players improve their skill with practice?)
38. [38] Lense of Challenge (What are the challenges in my game? Are they too easy, too hard or just right?)
54. [54] Lense of Accessibility (How will players know how to solve my puzzle? Does my puzzle or game act like something they have seen before?)

### Maybe
1. Lens of Emotion (what emotions would I like my player to experience and why? What emotions are they having, how can I bridge the gap if they don't feel that emotions)
3. Lens of Venue (What type of venue bests suits the game I'm trying to create? Does the venue have special properties that will influence my game and what elements of my game are in harmony with my venue and which are not?)
6. Lens of Curiosity (What questions does my game put into the player's mind? What am I doing to make them care about these questions? What can I do to make them invent even more questions?)
8. Lense of Problem Solving (What problems does my game ask the players to solve? Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of the gameplay? How can I generate new problems so that the players keep coming back?) -> maybe not because the problem is already clear

73. Lense of Story Machine (Is the story that important though?)
78. Lense of Story (Does my game really need a story, Why? Why will players be interested in this story? How does the sotry support other parts of the tetrad (Aesthetics, Technology Mechanics?))
79. Lense of Freedom
92. Lense of Inner Contradiction (What is the purpose of my game? Whar are the purposes of each subsystem in my game? Is there anything that contradicts these purposes?)
