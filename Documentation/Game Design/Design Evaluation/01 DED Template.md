## Game Lenses

### Lens of Flow

*Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?*

*Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?*

*Do parts of the game distract players so they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?*

*Does my game provide a steady stream of gradually increasing challenges?*

*Are the player's skills improving as expected? If not, how can I change that?*

### Lens of Skill

*What skills does my game require from the player?*

*Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?*

*Which skills are dominant?*

*Are these skills creating the experience I want?*

*Are some players much better at these skills than others?*

*Does this make the game feel unfair?*

*Can players improve their skills with practice?*

*Does this game demand the right level of skill?*

### Concept Dependent Lenses

*Define which Game Lenses you are going to use. Choose 1 to 5 matching ones and answer all the questions clear and concise*

*Are we able to answer them? Does it give a clear view about the game and gameplay?*

## Dynamics & Aesthetics

*Are the proposed aesthetics achieved with the current mechanics? Do the dynamics support the aesthetics? Do you agree with the proposed explanation in the GDD?*
