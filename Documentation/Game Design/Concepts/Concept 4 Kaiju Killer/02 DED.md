## Core Ideas and Values

### Serious Games

**Definition**: A game intending on teaching the player a concept or skill applicable in the real world.

The game attempts to teach linear equations by creating a learning environment for the student where he can practice already learned techniques. The game works best if th following requirement has been met: the teacher has already taught the student basic math and they are expected to have a basic level of understanding 

The math introduced in this game is applicable in the real world. Linear functions can be found in various implementations in real life, most obviously during tests at school. The game creates an environment which introduces a different experience from the typical classroom. This allows the player to see the math content from a new angle and experience something fresh.

The game serves primarily as an application to reinforce the player's mathematical skills by practising their previously established knowledge.

### Content

#### Learning Content

The learning content has been incorporated properly, as can be seen in the following:

1. Playing with the fundamental characteristics of a linear function first individually and then in combination.

> Not fulfilled, in the game the player is supposed to fill in entire equation, or the final answer. There is no manipulating *parts* of a function.
> *Partially* fulfilled, the player does not interact with the linear function by pressing a button but by entering the function by hand.

> @TriangledRat do you see filling in the entire equation as *playing with characteristics*? if you do its partially fulfilled, if you don't it's not.

2. Applying the fundamental characteristics to transform one representation (verbal, graph, formula, table) into another in a playful way.

> Fulfilled, the player can interact with multiple different ways of representations. For example the player has to adjust/fill-in the entire equation, fill-out a table and calculate intercepts. In the end these will be translated into the *ROBB-E PUNCH*!

3. Solving quests, tasks and problems involving multiple representations of linear function (verbal, graph, formula, table).

> Fulfilled, multiple representations can be found in the following:
>
> - Adjusting the linear equation to throw a punch at a kaiju.
> - Calculating intercepts to calculate the weak points of the kaiju.
> - Writing/completing in a table to define the trajectory of the punch.

4. Applying properties of linear functions to solve equations in a playful way.

> Fulfilled, the game offers multiple ways of solving the equations all packaged in this setting of killing kaiju as a mech (ROBB-E). I.e.: Filling in the linear equation, calculating intercepts, completing the values in a table.

5. Applying the appropriate function representation to solve a question or problem in the game.

> Fulfilled, the game offers various features and implementations of different function representations to solve the level at hand. They are usually translated by the player from a equation or a table into a punch.

@TriangledRat please state this in the GDD more clearly as concrete points for each learning goal!

#### Game Content

*How does the game include narrative, art, sound and further game and or level design?*

In order for the game to work properly it has to be implemented with at least full art! The core gameplay loop is very basic; interacting and writing functions. The experience is based very heavily on the polish, such as the story, art, SFX etc.. The narrative is cohesive and understandable; simple enough to be engaging without being overwhelming and taking away from the central plot point of learning linear equations. The levels and waves vary by having different types of enemies attack the player which also ties in the story. The levels, however, do have the potential to be extremely repetitive because the setting does not change. This could be countered by having different stages, different backgrounds and a big selection of how enemies look, behave, feel and act.

### Scalability

*Ability to include and expand on the learning goals.*
- The concept covers the learning goals 2-5 fully. On top of that the game allows for expansion by introducing new equations or alter the way they're used in the game.<!--and the first learning goal partially. -->
- Due to its simplicity the game is suited for expansion upon the established learning goals in different manners. For example the visual support, i.e. showing the trajectory of the punch, could be adjusted to more see through or non-visible.

*Ability to scale the content and duration of the game, allowing the client to expand in the future.*
- Story wise the game is very clear cut, but it allows future expansion to the gameplay by adding more stages, kaijus, waves etc..
- Content can easily be adjusted and added to the game by teachers or designers. This ensures that the concept can be expanded upon, therefore ensuring scalability as well. Kaiju Killer also allows future integration of quadratic functions, even though the current game is focused on linear equations (, tables and graphs).

### Adaptability

**Definition**: How well is the product able to be used in different situations, e.g. it can be used in the curriculum in multiple ways.

The current game play is most suited as a test environment, this makes the game very adaptable. It can be used at school as supplementary content for the classroom. It is most suited as an activity for students who have already finished their work and have to fill the last 10 min. of class. The fully developed version of the game can be adjusted by the teacher to lay the focus on specific questions, or interactions like tables, and can be played outside of the classroom to test and/or strengthen the knowledge of the students.

### Difficulty

#### Game Difficulty

**Definition**: The level of challenge the game content presents.

The game starts off with an easy way to interact with equations and introduces new ways of interacting the function. As the game progresses the interactions get progressively more difficult, but also give the player enough time to get familiar with the concept. The gameplay itself does not change much throughout the game which also makes it easy for inexperienced players to engage with the content. The game also offers two kinds of modifications for the player; first off parts which give ROBB-E extra or increased specs. and secondly purely aesthetical parts, these don't serve as upgrades but more as a form of self expression and are therefore not needed to complete the game. 

> @TriangledRat please make the distinction between the two types of parts clear (1. power-up, 2. aesthetical), or ensure that it's easy to understand that the existing type of parts has both functions (power-up, self-expression).

#### Mathematics Difficulty

**Definition**: The level of challenge the learning content presents.

The learning content in this game is very scalable. The difficulty of the mathematics can increased by making the math questions harder, or by altering visual elements such as the trajectory of the punch. For example the trajectory of the punch could be removed which would increase the complexity of the interaction. Throughout the game the player gets introduced to various ways to interact with linear equations and has enough time to get used to each of them. Which makes sure that the mathematical difficulty serves as a manageable, but challenging engagement.

### Accessibility

*Is the game accessible as defined by the team? Why? How?*

**Definition**: The player can play the game regardless of their mathematical skills, game skills and hardware.

- Mathematical skills: this game serves as a very good testing environment to reinforce the students knowledge, and understanding of linear equations. It does not introduce the player to new mathematical concepts in a understandable and cohesive way.
- Gameplay skills: the concept is very simplistic and presents itself with few types of input and interaction systems. This in turn makes it easier for new players to pick up by setting the entry bar low for inexperienced gamers.
- Hardware: the game is intended to be played on web, so the hardware is not a big focus. As long as the player has a browser, they are able to play the game.

### Core Values

#### Client Design Values

- Gameplay is entertainment first, education second
  - The game relies heavily on the use of visuals (including polish) to convey the story. Without these the gameplay experience suffers greatly. The game itself is centred on defeating waves of kaiju which places entertainment first and education second. The game introduces new ways to interact with the linear function gradually throughout the gameplay which makes it easy for the player to get used to the functions slowly and in a playful way.

- Complexity around linear functions is scalable
  - The complexity around the linear functions in this game is scalable. The designer can add or remove elements from the game like the visual trajectory (, which makes it easier for the player to see where he is going to hit,) so the gameplay becomes more challenging. This can be done for all of the ways the linear functions are interacted with in this game. The game also allows for more complex functions to be implemented which makes this game suitable to scalability.

- Gameplay needs to be validated through play tests by external players
  - Testing is planned for this concept.

- Target audience, aged 12 to 16, level VWO
  - Yes

- Gameplay is adaptable so it can be used inside and outside of the classroom
  - The gameplay is adaptable. It can be used within the class and the classroom for students who are bored or already finished with the work for this specific class as a 5 to 10min activity. It can also be used outside of the classroom in the players free time or as a extracurricular activity. The teacher also has the ability to create new and specific waves and elements that focus on one particular interaction with the function, which makes it easier for them to actually include this concept into the classroom.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  - This is fulfilled. The game is designed with web in mind as it presents a easy gameplay without a lot of rendering heavy elements and an easy input system.

- Authorability should be a key element
  - The game offers the ability for the teachers to create their own waves or levels and adjust already existing levels. This allows for a more seamless integration into classroom activities; it allows to set the focus on one specific function related interaction. 

#### Team Design Values

- Linear algebra has to be incorporated in the design of the core gameplay loop
  - The core gameplay loop is to type/interact with functions. This game fulfils this criteria by adjusting or writing linear equations the player fights with the enemies. Without this interaction the gameplay is close to non-existent.

- Fun has to be considered over education in design
  - The fun in this game relies heavily on how it looks and on the story. The concept in it's core (typing functions) is not fun or engaging in itself. But packaged as the kaiju killer it promises an engaging and fun experience.

- The game develops an understanding of the algebra it attempts to teach
  - The game sets out to consolidate knowledge that is already in existence and does not teach new concepts to the player. This game is best used in the context of the player already having a basic understanding of one type of interaction, for example writing the function on their own, and then practising this over and over again. 

- Accessible and designed to be easy to pick up
  - The game is very easy to pick up. The gameplay is not in any way complicated and only relies on the input / interaction with the function and not on any other fancy way of gameplay.

- Concept is scalable in complexity
  - The concept is very scalable as it allows for the teachers to create their own content. The concept is scalable in length but also in complexity of all the math aspects i.e. having different ways to interact with the function, having the option to ask harder questions and to make the questions harder not by increasing the difficulty of the math but by removing guidance like a visible trajectory.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  - The game is designed for web. It has a very simple input system and does not rely on hardware heavy graphics or interactions. 

## Game Lenses

### Lens of Flow

- *Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?*
    - The game has a clear goal of defeating the Kaiju, and saving the world by solving equations.

- *Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?*
    - Yes, the player has the goal of defeating the Kaiju and saving the world.
    - No, the player is not really guided on how to learn and/or apply the math they kinda get tested to do it.

- *Do parts of the game distract players so they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?*
    - There are no distractions as the game is very simplistic. Fill in the right equation/answer and the Kaiju will be hit.

- *Does my game provide a steady stream of gradually increasing challenges?*
  - Yes, the game steadily increases the difficulty of the questions and puzzles by removing helping visuals, more difficult math questions and by introducing new ways to interact with the math aspect i.e. tables.

- *Are the player's skills improving as expected? If not, how can I change that?*
  - This game works best in the setting of letting the student practice with the content provided. It should not serve as the only source of teaching. They cannot improve upon techniques they have not learned yet but can improve and/or reinforce their skill on already introduced math concepts. Gameplay wise the mechanics are simple and easy to understand; so the player does not need to improve their skills, but can focus on the math aspect.

### Lens of Skill

- *What skills does my game require from the player?*
  - The game has a very simple input system so it does not require the player to be familiar with gaming and the usual w,a,s,d or arrow keys for movement. Math wise they need to have a basic understanding of how linear functions work and know how to use the different ways a function can be represented i.e how a table works etc.

- *Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?*
  - The game does not cover verbal interaction with the mathematical aspect which is stated in the learning goals. But as this is very hard to achieve it can be left out without great impact. The game could be considered of missing the explanatory element, the player already has to have a basic understanding of math and the concepts the game tries to solidify.

- *Which skills are dominant?*
  - This game is designed with the mathematical aspect really being in the centre of the interaction which also makes them more dominant. For a game that attempts to teach linear equations this is perfect. 

- *Are these skills creating the experience I want?*
  - The experience we want the player to have is that he has enough time to learn and practice his mathematical skills related to linear functions and equations. This game gives the player the space to do so.

- *Are some players much better at these skills than others?*
  - Some students will inevitably be better at math than others; by having enough time to think about how they are going to solve the equation this problem is lessened as they don't have the preassure to perform.

- *Does this make the game feel unfair?*
  - No. The game also allows for the mech to be upgraded, which is not a necessity but can help the player and make for a more balanced gameplay experience. 

- *Can players improve their skills with practice?*
  - Yes, this game is aimed to give the player the space to practice their mathematical skills.

- *Does this game demand the right level of skill?*
  - It demands a stable basis of skill regarding the mathematical aspect. Other to that, the game has a easy to understand input system which makes it inviting for non-gamers to use as well.

### Concept Dependent Lenses

*Define which Game Lenses you are going to use. Choose 1 to 5 matching ones and answer all the questions clear and concise*

- [69] The Lens of Interest Curve

  - If I draw an interest curve of my experience, how is it shaped?
    - Start: very high, as the player does not know what to expect.
    - Midpoint: By introducing new enemies and new ways of interacting with the function the player can peak his interest. But it will inevitably fall again when the normal kaiju come and the game becomes repetitive.
    - End: high, as the player has to face off and defeat the final world-shattering kaiju.

  - Doest it have a hook?
    - The game does not have a specific hook. It counts on the player wanting to improve and defeat more kaiju. There is no promise made in the game that the player will have to defeat an end-boss and where he stands on the progression. The lack of progression makes it difficult for the player to build excitement/expectations for what is to come.

    > @TriangledRat maybe think about if you want to include some form of progression indication and maybe that there is in fact a world-shattering kaiju as an end boss which the players can look forward to.

  - Is there gradually rising interest, punctuated by periods of rest?
    - The game is based on waves with each wave having a boss. This peaks the interest each wave but it will deplete when the new wave starts and they have to fight normal kaiju again. The player can "rest" between each wave and modify their mech with modifications they picked up.

  - Is there a grand finale, more interesting than everything else?
    - Yes. As the finale the player has to face off the world-shattering kaiju and use all his knowledge to defeat him.

  - What changes would give me a better interest curve?
    - Maybe incorporate different world settings that indicate that the player is progressing. On top of that it'd be best to introduce more ways on how to progress in the game, i.e. instead of punching use a laser cannon. Otherwise if the everything stays the same and just the math input methods change the experience will become jarring fairly quick.

  - Is there a fractural structure to my interest curve?
    - Yes. The interest peaks ever so slightly during the wave, i.e. whilst meeting a new (type) of kaiju and when a wave boss has been reached. During the middle part the game gets repetitive making the interest drop until it stagnates and stays continuous. 

  - Do my intuitions about the interest curve match the observed interest of the players? If I ask play testers to draw an interest cure, what does it look like?
    - *We cannot answer this question as of now*


## Dynamics & Aesthetics

*Are the proposed aesthetics achieved with the current mechanics? Do the dynamics support the aesthetics? Do you agree with the proposed explanation in the GDD?*

**Sensation**: Game as sense pleasure

- Once the game would be fully finished the player can experience a lot of visual satisfaction. This would be due to the implementation of the art style, polish. On top of that auditory satisfaction will be able to be found due to background music, SFX etc.
- > This is likely to be extremely dependent on the implementation chapter (i.e. polish etc.).

**Fantasy**: Game as make believe

- The game is set in a fantasy setting with robots fighting kaijus in order to save the world. The player is a robot called "robbie" and fights wave after wave on incoming enemies. He has to prepare, gear and level up to be ready for the killer-kaiju which threatens to destroy the world! The fantasy aspect is very good described and presents itself as an immersive and cohesive story.

**Challenge**: Game as obstacle course

- Challenge is supported in the way that a punch is thrown, the player has to solve the equations before they can progress. The player has multiple chances to solve an equation and has no time pressure. The game has a steady progression through the way it introduces new ways to interact with the mathematical aspect i.e linear equations. In addition to that, the game also can be made harder in various different ways for each idea on how to interact with the function.

**Expression**: Game as self-discovery

- The game supports self-discovery by allowing the player to pick what parts should be added to the robot.
- > Please describe a bit more how you'd envision this, what parts can be changed? can different parts be selected? why would they pick different parts (do they have stats)?

## Notes

Dynamics:

- No headers added, although the readability has improved it's still a bit messy to read because there are no headers.
- Picture descriptions, add descriptions to the pictures i.e. what are we looking at? which stage are we looking at? what is happening?

Math didactics:

- Keep bullet points/list, please describe per learning goal how you believe it is implemented, this saves us some time.

Progression:

- You kinda wrote down what the overall game loopst should look like instead you should describe what is to be expected in a level:
  - What does the prototype look like?
  - What are the fail criteria?
  - What functionalities can you expect?
- How is the final demo level supposed to look like?
  - What type of enemies do we expect?
- What does each section look like?

HUD and UI:
- Button Menu implies that it takes you back to the main menu

Difficulty:

- Describe in more detail how the difficulty progresses, right now it describes the punching only.
  - What does the game start with, how do these functionalities get more difficult?
  - How does the math get more difficult?
  - How do the enemies get more difficult?
  - How do the stages get more difficult?
  - etc...

Game-Loop:

- Create more detailed descriptions,
  - when is the math done?
  - what do we need to do to pick up parts?
  - If we do not pick up parts are we part of the same loop?
  - What happens if they lose a run?
- Please add more details,
  - The game loop should have flow chart symbols i.e. start/end, step, decision, action (see discord resources or ask Chantal)
    - You can create a mermaid diagram and then yap a bit about what is shown in it.
    - When does the loop end, how does it end?
    - What decisions does the player have to make? when?
  - I.e. what is the progression in the:
    - Short-term loop (states)?
    - Small medium-term (wave)?
    - Big medium-term (section)?
    - Long-term (world)?

Feedback-Loops:

- Which ones are positive and which ones are negative?
- Add headers to all of the feedback-loops, what is what etc.
- Some feedback-loops are rather small (without the star even just one nodes?)
  1. What is happening here? are we punching? why is it not described in the loop? what are we using the function for?
  2. How do we pick-up parts? If we do not pick-up parts are we still in this loop? This info should be in the game loop as well but it's not there.
  3. How does this loop differ from number 2? It's described how parts do not have to be picked-up but why is this not shown in the diagram?
  4. There is a node missing, basically the one that describes the action *before* you miss the punch -> `throw punch` or `do calculation`

Resources:

- Remove headers if they're not going to be used, example: Currencies, Kaiju Killer does not have currencies.
- Implementation:

  - How is the input of the function going to look like?
  - Where is it placed on the screen?
