# Architect of Goo: Design Evaluation Template

`v3.0`

## Core Ideas and Values

### Serious Games

Architect of Goo succeeds well at being a serious game according to our definitions; it has incorporated mathematics into its core gameplay loop, providing a foundation for the mechanics that can't be removed without needing a redesign of the mechanics as a whole. It intends to teach and allow players to practice, but actively forces them to think about what they are doing by requiring them to consider each aspect carefully. 

### Content

#### Learning Content

1. Playing with the fundamental characteristics of a linear function ~~first~~ individually ~~and then in combination.~~
    - Fulfilled as specified.
2. Applying the fundamental characteristics to transform one representation (graph, formula, table) into another in a playful way.
    - Fulfilled, though in the current GDD not to a high extent - there's a lot of considerations as to different applications of linear functions, but not necessarily different representations.
3. Solving quests, tasks and problems involving multiple representations of linear function (graph, formula).
    - Fullfilled. All the puzzles in order to advance require linear functions, or properties thereof, to be transformed into another object that the player then uses to advance.
4. Applying properties of linear functions to solve equations in a playful way.
    - Fulfilled.
5. Applying the appropriate function representation to solve a question or problem in the game.
    - Fulfilled; the player has to actively select the correct gem - thus the correct 'kind' of solution to the problem they are presented with.

#### Game Content

The game takes its own narrative into account in every aspect and provides a very fun, completed world for the player to mess about in while not being too overwhelming in lore or story. Architect of Goo does, to some degree, need a correct art direction in order to make the narrative visually enjoyable and not become too bland or repetitive. However, the narrative as it is currently posed does allow for a lot of flexibility in this, giving room for interesting worlds or playing around with color schemes and world objects.

Keeping the level designs varied is very important to not make the game too boring; the amount of power the teacher will have in level editing will have to be considered as teachers are not game designers and might end up with a level that is functional, but not fun to play, deterring the students from actively engaging with the work they are given. On the flip side, game designers might focus too much on a level that is fun to play rather than a level that is teaching actively. Finding a middle ground in this should be a priority for later iterations.

### Scalability

The game does allow for a great deal in scalability; both in gameplay elements in for example the length of the levels and size of the puzzles, but also for mathematic concepts. In designing the mechanics, the ability to apply different kinds of functions was actively considered. However, the gameplay is limited to mathematic concepts that revolve around functions - this seems to be an unavoidable problem, with how tightly the mathematics are interwoven into the mechanics, but this is not a fault of the design itself, simply a sacrifice that needs to be made to achieve the other goals.

### Adaptability

The game is decently adaptable for both in-classroom use and outside. Giving the teacher authorability on level design gives this game an advantage to be used as an add-on to the curriculum, as the teacher can decide what questions or what kind of interactions the students should practice. The world and the level structure of the game does also invite the player to play it outside of class, as they are fun puzzles and challenges to solve once the base skillset has been taught.

### Difficulty

#### Game Difficulty

*Does the game difficulty align with what the team defined? How? Why?*

The game offers a lot of different avenues to solve the problems the player faces and allows for a lot of expression of skills and knowledge this way. The mechanics are not so difficult to understand that those without gaming experience will have trouble picking it up and what everything in the game means, and what it does, is easy to grasp. However, the gameplay is more involved, meaning that this game will appeal more to those with more experience in games than those without, and is not likely to be played outside of the classroom unless the student enjoys games as a hobby.

#### Mathematics Difficulty

*Does the mathematics difficulty align with what the team defined? How? Why?*

Architect of Goo provides a challenge with various levels of difficulty within the gems that can be increased gradually over time. However, the GDD does not strictly outline whether there's a progression in how the skill gems are obtained; whether they're all available at the start, or as the player progresses through levels, more become available. This sort of progression is key to how the difficulty of the mathematics play out - learning intercepts generally happens after learning how linear functions work to begin with. If this is clarified, then Architect of Goo aligns in math difficulty with the team definition.

### Accessibility

*Is the game accessible as defined by the team? Why? How?*

The game does not require a lot of extensive hardware; the style is simplistic and the required animations, effects and other polish are deliberately limited in scope so the game can run on any machine from a web browser. Important to keep in mind in later development is to not go overboard - simplicity often pushes people in the direction of doing more elaborate things with simple items, but it must be kept in mind that this game is meant to be simple. 

As stated above, the gradual introduction of the mechanics might not be as present; in general, this game is better suited to those already familiar with all concepts regarding linear functions so it can be enjoyed at its full capacity. New concepts are not taught, but the game offers a very suitable practice space.

The other gameplay is straightfoward and easy to understand. The lack of time limitation and the lenience in returning to checkpoints allows even non-gamers to play it and not get too frustrated. However, the game is likely to draw in more students who are experienced with games and play them as a hobby rather than newcomers to the media.

### Core Values

#### Client Design Values

- Gameplay is entertainment first, education second
  - Fulfilled; the game's design is focused around the fun-factor, with the mechanics adapted around linear functions. The game doesn't hide it is trying to practice linear functions with the player, but has 'disguised' them into a digestable, fun experience.

- Complexity around linear functions is scalable
  - Fullfilled - new concepts around linear functions can be introduced in the gameplay in the form of new gems or new obstacles for the player to work around. Other concepts surrounding functions can also be introduced. Already present mechanics can be scaled in difficulty in both how they need to be applied in a puzzle, but also in how the player interacts with them.

- Gameplay needs to be validated through play tests by external players
  - Testing is planned.

- Target audience, aged 12 to 16, level VWO
  - Fulfilled.

- Gameplay is adaptable so it can be used inside and outside of the classroom
  - Fulfilled to a degree; this mostly presents itself in the ability of a teacher to design their own levels to supplement their own curriculum. Beyond this, the game's design is so that it *could* be used in a classroom, but is likely better suited as a supplementary activity.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  - Fulfilled, the control scheme is straightfoward, understandable, and the graphical requirements aren't too high, allowing it to run on web smoothly.

- Authorability should be a key element
  - The level structure and level creator allow for teachers to create their own levels and thus approaches for a player to take. This gives them options on how to integrate the game within their curriculums, fulfilling the requirement for authorability.

#### Team Design Values

- Linear algebra has to be incorporated in the design of the core gameplay loop
  - Fulfilled; all aspects of traversing the level's obstacles involve linear algebra in some way.

- Fun has to be considered over education in design
  - Fulfilled; the game's design is focused around the fun-factor, with the mechanics adapted around linear functions. The game doesn't hide it is trying to practice linear functions with the player, but has 'disguised' them into a digestable, fun experience

- The game develops an understanding of the algebra it attempts to teach
  -  Depending on how the mechanics are introduced and what the difficulty scaling is, this is fulfilled. This should be kept in mind in level designs going forward.

- Accessible and designed to be easy to pick up
  - Mostly fulfilled; the control scheme is easy to grasp and very straightforward, and the design of the UI makes approaching the mechanics simple. However, it does require some level of understanding of the math concepts the mechanics use, or else the player might end up lost.

- Concept is scalable in complexity
  - Fullfilled - new concepts around linear functions can be introduced in the gameplay in the form of new gems or new obstacles for the player to work around. Other concepts surrounding functions can also be introduced. Already present mechanics can be scaled in difficulty in both how they need to be applied in a puzzle, but also in how the player interacts with them.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  - Fulfilled, the control scheme is straightfoward, understandable, and the graphical requirements aren't too high, allowing it to run on web smoothly.


## Game Lenses

### Lens of Flow

*Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?*
- The player's goal is to reach the end of the level and to head home, and this is clear in the structure.

*Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?*
- The player's goal to finish the level and complete their math tasks aligns with that of the overal narrative; to go home. 

*Do parts of the game distract players so they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?*
- Some additional extras might incentivise the player to stray from the goal to explore the level more. To some degree, there has to be a reward for this in place if it is something that is desired to be kept - if the player discovers a new place, and gets a coin, is there something they can do with this coin? Is there a reason to find this?

*Does my game provide a steady stream of gradually increasing challenges?*
- The mathematics increasingly becomes more difficult, new concepts are introduced, and the levels are scalable in difficulty and overal size, providing a nice curve in difficulty that continue to challenge the player as they go along.

*Are the player's skills improving as expected? If not, how can I change that?*
- Depending on the structure of the levels per world, the skill increase might be lacking. Important is to keep pacing well; though this is a concern for later iterations and after more testing of the individual gems and corrosponding mechanics.

### Lens of Skill

*What skills does my game require from the player?*
- The game requires the player to have knowledge of linear functions, as well as some understanding of how games are played on a basic level. The gameplay is straightforward beyond this.

*Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?*
- The game poses itself as a platformer, but misses some platforming elements and focuses very heavily on just using math skills as mechanics. Some basic platforming skills as a hook for the player could be introduced, make the game feel more like a game.

*Which skills are dominant?*
- Math skills are highly dominant in the gameplay loop. Every aspect of moving through the level successfully beyond the basic movement left and right requires the player to think about a math concept and apply that to the game.

*Are these skills creating the experience I want?*
- As the game is a serious game intended for the player to practice their math skills in a playful way, yes; the skills required of the player mold the intended experience quite well. 

*Are some players much better at these skills than others?*
- It is inevitable that players have a difference in math skills, or game skills. The lack of time pressure, as well as the room for new attempts due to the placement of checkpoints, as well as the sliamond in the rough mechanic, are very valuable in this regard, giving the player opportunities to still progress, even if it is in a slower fashion or with some training wheels attached.

*Does this make the game feel unfair?*
- The game does not have a competitive angle. Players do not play against each other - they can aid each other if necessary, but there is no way one can beat the other by being better at math. This makes the game feel plenty fair. There is no rush or pressure to perform well, just to practice, learn, and progress at their own pace.

*Can players improve their skills with practice?*
- Yes; the game provides plenty of 'do overs' so the player has ample opportunity to learn their errors and how to fix these. There might be a necessity for the player to practice their math skills outside of the game in order to fully grasp the mechanics - it might be worth to revisit this in future iterations.

*Does this game demand the right level of skill?*
- Yes, *if* these skills are introduced in a way that is well-paced. It is important to facillitate growth in the way the levels are structured; if gems are introduced too quickly, the learning curve might end up really steep and demand a higher level of skill than is reasonable.

### Concept Dependent Lenses


[10]The Lens of Holographic Design
*What elements of the game make the experience enjoyable?*
- The narrative, as well as the visuals, play a big part in the initial hook for the game - making players see past the 'math game' aspect of it all. The large variety of mechanics in the gems, as well as the ability to constantly introduce new levels, keep the player engaged and interested in playing the game. As their skills refine, the game becomes more and more fun to play each time.

*What elements may detract from the experience?*
- The pacing and structure of the levels might be too overwhelming all at once - it does require a rather expansive knowledge of math concepts in order to use all mechanics to their full potential. In addition, having to consider what mechanic to use might be too much for a player if they're also trying to grasp the concept to begin with.

*How can I change game elements to improve the experience?*
- Pacing is key; how the mechanics are introduced and perhaps also get more difficult over time is important to consider, especially in the level designs. If this is done well, the steep learning curve can be levelled out and feel more of a challenge to overcome rather than a test. Giving more guidance at first and then putting players in a position where they have to make the choices themselves could also help.


[24] The Lens of Novelty
*What is novel about my game?*
- The constant introduction of new gems - mechanics - introducing new level structures and allowing the player to play around with new ways of progressing. On top of that, the way the math is incorporated in the game is rather novel by itself, a new and interesting thing for the player to do their homework.

*Does my game have novelties throughout or just at the beginning?*
- Granted the pacing is done well, the game constantly introduces new mechanics for the player to enjoy. There is dropoff eventually, having no more new things to introduce - but if paced well, this dropoff won't be reached for a while.

*Do I have the right mix of the novel and the familiar?*
- This also depends on level structure. It is important to not hyperfixate on newly introduced gems, but keep older kinds of gems scattered throughout. This is also a good callback to revisit older concepts, from an educational standpoint.

*When the novelty wears off, will players still enjoy my game?*
- Considering the wide possibilities of level design, adding to the existing pool of levels, or even content updates as time goes on, this game continues to be interesting for people who grasp the mechanics. It provides new puzzles each time for the player to solve and consider and keeps the game enjoyable; however it might not be as interesting outside of a math class. While the mechanics are interesting challenges on their own, the math aspect might be too much to continue being interesting after the subject has been closed in a school setting.


## Dynamics & Aesthetics

Challenge
  > We want our player to be challenged by the gameplay and the math aspect. The player should use his grey brain cells to solve the equations and by extension the levels
  - Fulfilled. Within the design, there's a lot of consideration on how to approach challenges for the player - in both the level design as a whole, and mechanics by themselves by giving them difficulty increases. In some areas there might be just a bit too much challenge; keep this in mind in later iterations for design to pace the player and give them the space to grow and learn. 

Discovery
  > We want our player to use his curiosity and creativity to discover different possibilities to solve the level and to advance through the game by trial and error
  - Fulfilled. This is very well facilitated by the use of checkpoints and the structure of being level-based. There's room to make mistakes without being punished too hard; there's help if there's a struggle so the player can learn more. There could be different ways of solving levels, giving room for a lot of expression and experimentation to try and make things work.

  Fantasy could also be a very worthwhile addition to the aesthetics as the narrative and the world setting play a big part of the game's overal presentation to the player. You are a cute little slime, interacting with the world in a slimey way; the narrative and mechanics are intertwined and can be highlighted as such.


  ### Notes

  Honestly, I don't have many notes to give you due to time constraints, but I really want to say you guys took the feedback from last time to heart and did really well incorporating this in your new design and how you describe it! This game honestly looks like a lot of fun and something I would spend a lot of time on in high school. 

  The only big feedback I can give is that you do talk a lot about progression; but keeping mechanic introduction in mind and the progression therein would be worthwhile. It feels a little uncertain now and that could open a hole of thinking that everything is available all at once. Talk a bit about your level structures!

  And some formatting stuff; capitalized things in the middle while other things aren't capitalized. Nothing too big, but keep in mind especially for client deliveries and stuff.
