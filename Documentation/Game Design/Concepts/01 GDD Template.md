# [Title]: Game Design Document

`v2.3`

Template to create a Game Design Document (GDD) for our concepts.

<!-- Be sure to write everything as concise as possible! -->

## Concept

<!-- Describes the theoretical/high-level conceptual foundation of the game. -->

### Mission

Within one or two sentences describe in abstract terms what (action, feeling, gameplay) the game should achieve, the core of the game.

<!-- E.g. "When you're stuck as can be, just destroy and you'll see" -->

### Design Pillars

Choose words that fit the emotional core of the game and describe them as if you are currently experiencing them during gameplay.

<!--

  E.g.

  `Chaos`: It is chaotic and unpredictable I don't know what will happen next.

  `Instant Feedback`: I get instant feedback on my actions.

  `Destruction`: I can destroy almost everything in the game.

 -->

### Aesthetics

The types of fun we want to achieve with our design.

<!--

    Choose the aesthetics that fit the emotional core that should be at the heart of the game.

    1. Sensation
    2. Fantasy
    3. Narrative
    4. Challenge
    5. Fellowship
    6. Discovery
    7. Expression
    8. Submission

## Design

<!-- Describe the high-level design of the game. -->

### Mechanics

<!-- 

*What are the mechanics of the game?* #ONION :D 

If using the onion diagram using draw.io or others, please use/export as svg (not png)!

-->

#### Core Mechanics

Most used mechanics in the game, are always performed by the player.

#### Secondary Mechanics

Supporting mechanics that are used less frequently.

### Dynamics

*What are the game dynamics?*

Place the mechanics into the game's conceptual context and argue if they evoke the correct aesthetics

### Math Didactics

#### Learning Goals

*Which goals are approached with the (current) design?*

#### Implementation

*How is it combined/achieved with the mechanics?*

### Economy

Describe what the player can collect and use in the game.

#### Resources

Resources are things the player can produce or has in the game with a specific purpose. E.g. wood, tools, food, health, etc.

*What are the resources in the game?*

What are the resources that the player can collect and use?

#### Currencies

Currencies are things the player can generate and use in the game to buy or sell things (it has a self influencing feedback loop). E.g. gold, money, skill points, etc.

*Which currencies are in the game?*

What are the currencies that the player can collect and use?

#### Consumables

Consumables are things the player can collect and use once. E.g. potions, scrolls, etc.

*What are the consumables in the game?*

What are the consumables that the player can collect and use?

### Progression

*How does the game progress?*

How does the game start? How does the game evolve over time? What is the player's journey?

### Loops

*What are the loops of the game?*

#### Game Loop

What are the short-term, medium-term, and long-term loops? What are the effects of the actions of the player

Please use mermaid diagrams for this!

Mermaid diagram nodes syntax: https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html

Book about game flow chart diagrams: https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-game-design/9781787121799/b3322c72-3fbc-4407-be07-0abc2ca5070b.xhtml

- Rounded squares represent terminal blocks (beginnings and ends of processes)
- A parallelogram is used for user input/output
- Diamonds portray decisions. Use these for simple yes/no or true/false forks
- Rectangles are used for processes and operations
- Arrow connectors are used to join parts of the diagram and portray the direction of transitions
- On-page connectors (the circles with letters inside) allow us to avoid long and confusing arrows by connecting two remote parts of the flow

-->

#### Feedback Loops

What are the positive and negative influences of the mechanics upon each other?

## Implementation

<!-- Describe the implementation of the game. -->

### Target Platform

Describe the target platform of the game, e.g. mobile, desktop, mobile-web, desktop-web etc.

### Camera

Describe the camera view and how it should behave.

### Controls

Describe the controls of the game, e.g. keyboard, mouse, touch, etc.

### User Interface

<!-- Use tools like Penpot & Figma -->

Describe the different interfaces like the main menu, settings, HUD, etc.

### Game Objects

Describe the different game objects in the game, their purpose and how they interact with the player.

### Polish

Describe the different polish elements in the game, e.g. particles, animations, etc.

### Story

Describe the concept of the story of the game.

### Sound

Describe the sound design of the game, what feelings should the player have when hearing the sounds?

### Art

Describe the art style of the game, what feelings should the player have when seeing the art?
