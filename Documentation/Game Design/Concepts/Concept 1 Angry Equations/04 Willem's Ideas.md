## Level Design

  ![Level Design Image](./Resources/Level_Design_Idea.png)
  Keeping the design simple, I opted to have 2 enemies and they’re both in relatively reachable positions. It’s likely that if you hit the block indicated by the green star, that the front part of the fortress collapses and takes out both enemies (red circles). Meaning that the player virtually can’t mess up this level. The solid grey box is not destructible and contains the loot.

## Level Mechanics:

The player has 3 ammunition. Each ammunition explodes on impact, expanding outwards forces on all destructible objects surrounding the impact.
Once all enemies are eliminated, the level is completed and the monkey can collect the loot.

## Level Score System:

How well you completed a level will be depicted in the amount of bananas. With either 1, 2 or 3.
Each block that you destroy in the level will give 100 points. Each defeated enemy gives 500 points. Each ammunition that hasn’t been used gives you another 500 points.
The amount of bananas (think of it as a star system) rewarded will be based on the points the player got. For example: 2000p or more is 3 bananas, between 1500p and 2000p is 2 bananas and less than 1500p is 1 banana.
The actual thresholds would have to be tested for.

## Progression System:

(Progression doesn’t have to be implemented because it would require a pretty hefty amount of levels. It’s just to illustrate a possible way to increase the scope of the game)

The player gathers bananas rewarded from the levels. Once a banana has been earned, that level can no longer reward it to the player's total.

Every 10 bananas, the player can advance the skill tree.

Ideas for the powerups:
Increase in ammunition (making it possible to get higher scores because the player can keep more at the end of a level)
Increase in explosion radius/power
Upon impact, ammunition splits up into 2 more that cause smaller explosions left and right.
