# Inspiration Analysis: Angry Birds

`Angry Birds` itself is a very simplistic game, and because our game is based on the idea of `Angry Birds` they share similar values. According to Iisalo and Lehtinen the following was important for *Angry Birds*[^1]:

- Recognition
- Simplicity 
- Accessibility
- Satisfaction   
- Social Engagement and Competition

Combining the design pillars of the original `Angry Birds` with the requirements and vision of our team (and the client) led us to the above mentioned list of design pillars. This is how we translated the design pillars used in *Angry Birds*:

- **Recognition**, since *Angry Birds* has become such a well-known game the way that `destruction` has been portrayed in the game itself has become well-known as well. This should lead to **emotional satisfaction** as well.

- **Simplicity**, the concept and functions in this game should be simple as well to make it more `adaptive`, `easy to replay` and `scalable`.

- **Accessibility**, by keeping our game simplistic it should be `easy to replay` and `inclusive` for children who
  
  1. do not play many games
  2. have difficulty with math (linear equations)

- **Satisfaction**, the game should bring the player **emotional satisfaction**. This can be done by using:
  
  - `competition`, children will become excited if they win, happy to complete the  level, and start anticipating the next levels/opponents.
  - `destruction`, many will find it interesting and/or exciting to destroy something (which they normally aren't allowed to do).
  - `aiming`, in-game the function will be portrayed whilst aiming, this leads to satisfaction and understanding as the player will be able to see the direct result of their actions.  
  - `learning goals`, by performing the actions many times the players will start to get familiar with the linear functions and how they've been altering them this should lead to excitement as they will start to understand the math slowly but surely. Making it al the more important to properly tweak the `difficulty` progressively, therefore making it a very `adaptable` game.

- **Social engagement and** `competition`, this should lead to satisfaction, excitement, disappointment and unwillingness as the players will try and beat the people in their surroundings.
