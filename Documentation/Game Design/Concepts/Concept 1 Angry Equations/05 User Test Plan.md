# Angry Equations: User Test Plan

User Test Plan Template: `v1.2`

## Context

### Concept

Angry equations presents the player with the challenge of solving levels by shooting projectiles using linear equations. The game is inspired by the popular game Angry Birds and aims to teach the player about linear equations in a fun and engaging way.

The design itself has not been evaluated per our evaluation process. A quick guerilla/open user test has presented us with the following:

- They didn't feel a connection between the function input and the output on the screen.
- The B (y-manipulation) button is currently useless in the level where you don't influence only B (tutorial level 2).
- Having to press the B (y-manipulation) button repeatedly is not desired for the gameplay.

### Goals

Based on the feedback from the guerilla test & our design values, we want to test the following:

- The connection between user input and the output on-screen
- The intuitiveness of the control scheme
- The general gameplay experience of the player
- The didactic value of the game

### Hypotheses

We believe that the player will have a positive experience with the game and will be able to learn about linear equations in a fun and engaging way. The player will be able to connect the input they provide to the output on the screen and will be able to finish the levels within a set amount of time.

## Design

### Participants

The participants for this test will only be our target audience of students from the VWO & HAVO level currently studying mathematics. The math curriculum (A, B, C or D) they follow will be varying, as well as their level of proficiency in the subject matter and their age.

### Methods

For this user test we have decided to use the following methods:

- Observation of the player during the game
- Interview with the player after the game

To achieve this we will need the following:

- Build of the game
- Laptop or desktop with mouse input to play the game
- Stopwatch
- Data collection form

### Metrics & Benchmarks

From our `02 Benchmarks & Metrics` document we have selected and placed the following metrics & benchmarks in context of this concept:

---
