# Slope Swing: Design Evaluation Template

`v1.0`

## Core Ideas and Values

### Serious Games

Definition: A game intending on teaching the player a concept or skill applicable in the real world.

Slope Swing is a game intended to get students involved in mathematics in a playful, engaging way. It does not teach these concepts on its own, but rather provides a supplementary activity to lessons in order to strengthen newfound knowledge. It involves *all* students in a classroom activity, taking a break from monotony of class and creating a fun space for the player to learn in, providing a newer and fresher environment.

The game does not teach however and the player's interactions with linear functions are rather limited in scope. Slope Swing really is a game about reinforcing knowledge and practicing it in a playful environment as a supplement. 

### Content

#### Learning Content

1. ~~Playing with the fundamental characteristics of a linear function first individually and then in combination.~~
    - While crossed out fully, the game does allow for playing with the fundemantal characteristics of a linear function individually, albeit only the a value in a y = ax + b equation.
2. Applying the fundamental characteristics to transform one representation (verbal, graph, formula, table) into another in a playful way.
    - Fulfilled, as the player has to edit a function to get a graph line to aim their golf ball. These are, however, the only representations present in the game.
3. Solving quests, tasks and problems involving multiple representations of linear function (verbal, graph, formula, table).
    - Fulfilled, as the player has to edit a function to get a graph line to aim their golf ball, but again these are the only representations in the game.
4. ~~Applying properties of linear functions to solve equations in a playful way.~~
    - Not applied.
5. Applying the appropriate function representation to solve a question or problem in the game.
    - Partially fulfilled seeing as the player has to adapt a function to aim the ball, but they are not offered various representations of the graph to pick a correct one.



#### Game Content

*How does the game include narrative, art, sound and further game and or level design?*

The game does not require many objects in order to function, as the game has no real plot or story. For the most part, it relies on the player's desire to perform well in the game and be on a leaderboard with their peers - the drive to compete. The gameplay is in itself simple, trying to putt a ball in the least amount of strokes. The players do not interact with each other on the field, unless they are giving aid through phone-a-friend, but the competition is entirely driven by their own performance and their wishes for how well they do. The simple structure of the game lends well to this, as there aren't many systems or objects to keep track of while the player does their thing. 

Visually and in terms of audio, the game has to be eye-catching and interesting without being too repetitive. Keeping a simple, bold style works well, but must not be too childish. The linked example of Golf Story does this well - simple, without being too childlike and risking a patronizing simplicity.

### Scalability

*How does the scalability show in this game? Can the concept be applied to multiple Learning Goals? Does the content and duration of the game allow to be expand upon in the future?*

As the concept is right now, the scalability is limited. There are no other described ways of putting, meaning the player only has the ability to put through editing the function. This means that other learning goals can't be applied very well, or be applied in a limited capacity due to the nature of the graphics. While the game's difficulty could scale in the way the courses are designed, the math difficulty would not scale much if at all - though this is not defined.

The game could have more scalability introduced, but it would require a slight change of world interaction as well. Different ways of aiming could pose different challenges, like Golf With Friends does with different shaped 'golf balls'. 


### Adaptability

*Does it align with how the team defined adaptability? Is it an adaptable game? How? Why?*

Slope Swing lends itself best to a classroom environment, wrapping up a lesson and drawing the attention from the students back to the learning material. The activity is entirely class-based, led by a teacher with as many students as possible participating to get a large result board going and motivating students to try harder on their next attempt to reach higher on another leaderboard. 

This game could technically be played outside of class as well, instigated by students on their own time, but would likely not find much traction this way as the mechanics are still very simple and based around mathematics. While it has a lot of draw in the classroom, outside it would fall a little short. With it needing at least a host and then a separate player, the game requires a larger group to be played and outside of a classroom environment, this will be harder to facilitate. 

A potentially larger issue with Slope Swing is the limitations of its mechanics. With how the design is set up right now, it only allows for one mechanic in aiming; adjusting the function, but only one element thereof. This means that the game isn't likely to be useful across the curriculum for linear equations, but would only provide an engaging way to lay the foundations and not much else. 

### Difficulty

#### Game Difficulty

**Definition**: The level of challenge the game content presents.

The progression of the difficulty in courses is not clearly defined; however there is a difficulty setting visible on the UI screens, meaning that the teacher can determine the difficulty of the courses. Generally, the mechanics of the game are very simple and the trajectory of the ball is not only displayed, but can be somewhat predicted based on the speed the player hits the ball with. They are not too difficult to understand and step into. Whether the game gets more difficult over time is not too clear, but if applied, should be a gradual scale without a spike too high that makes the game frustrating to play.

The secret hole might be a slight point of frustration if it is too difficult to find. The placement should make sense for a player to search at without being too arbitrary - otherwise, this turns from a point of skill to randomly putting until the secret hole is hit.

#### Mathematics Difficulty

*Does the mathematics difficulty align with what the team defined? How? Why?*

**Definition**: The level of challenge the learning content presents.

The learning content in this game is rather limited in the way it is currently described. There is only one way of interacting with linear functions, and that method remains throughout the game. It does not scale in difficulty outside of requiring more precision if the courses get harder. This leaves the usability of this game in the context of a classroom or a curriculum rather limited. It serves well as an introductory game after the topic is first discussed in class, and some initial practice, but outside of that has little merit as a teaching or practicing tool. 

### Accessibility

*Is the game accessible as defined by the team? Why? How?*

**Definition**: The player can play the game regardless of their mathematical skills, game skills and hardware.

- Math skills: The math required of this game is very low-entry and can be picked up easily, allowing many different skill levels to interact with the game right off the bat. It does not introduce any new concepts outside of the one they are given right away.
- Game skills: Golf games are easy to pick up, as their mechanics and how the world interacts with itself is very akin to real life, giving a good deal of predictablity to the player's actions. Some courses might require more skill and fine-tuning, but not in a capacity that gamers would have an advantage over non-game enthusiasts.
- Hardware: The mechanics and the graphical requirements lend well to any kind of hardware. The UI might need adjustments to play well on a mobile device, but this is not something that cannot be mitigated. There are plenty of golf games for phones that can be referenced.

### Core Values

#### Client Design Values

*Does the game align with the client design values? How? Why?*

- Gameplay is entertainment first, education second
  - Fulfilled; the game focuses on a fun classroom experience that everyone can share in a positive way. Math is there, and it is not hidden in any way, but it is shaped in a way that is intended to be entertaining rather than overtly educational.

- Complexity around linear functions is scalable
  - Not fulfilled; the way linear functions are interacted with and applied remains the same across the game and the way the mechanics are currently designed, do not allow for much change or scaling.

- Gameplay needs to be validated through play tests by external players
  - Playtesting is not scheduled for this concept due to time constraints.

- Target audience, aged 12 to 16, level VWO
  - Fulfilled, but would be more suited for the lower ages of this bracket.

- Gameplay is adaptable so it can be used inside and outside of the classroom
  - Not fulfilled; the game really only lends itself to a classroom use due to the lobby system, phone-a-friend, and leaderboards. The game could be played by students on their own incentive, but is not likely to find much traction this way.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  - Fulfilled; the graphics are simple and the control scheme can be applied across devices. UI and layout might need some adjusting, but this is a minor issue.

- Authorability should be a key element
  - Not fulfilled. The teacher can set the difficulty of the game in lobby, but in what way this would be more difficult, or how the player interacts with linear functions, cannot be specified at all.


#### Team Design Values

*Does the game align with the team design values? How? Why?*

- Linear algebra has to be incorporated in the design of the core gameplay loop
  - Fulfilled; the main gameplay is centered around aiming using linear equations. 

- Fun has to be considered over education in design
  - Fulfilled; the game focuses on a fun classroom experience that everyone can share in a positive way. Math is there, and it is not hidden in any way, but it is shaped in a way that is intended to be entertaining rather than overtly educational.

- The game develops an understanding of the algebra it attempts to teach
  - Somewhat fulfilled; the way the player adjusts the linear function may not make it much of a teaching moment rather than a visual explanation of a linear function. This does however allow for a greater understanding in how linear functions work at the core and train the player to visually recognize a linear function in a graph, as well as what its associated function would be.

- Accessible and designed to be easy to pick up
  - Mechanics are simple to understand for gamers and non-gamers alike. The math is similarly not to difficult to step into, all of which makes it accessible to get into and play.

- Concept is scalable in complexity
  - Not fulfilled; the way linear functions are interacted with and applied remains the same across the game and the way the mechanics are currently designed, do not allow for much change or scaling. The courses could become considerably more difficult over time, but this is not clearly specified in the concept currently.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  -  Fulfilled; the graphics are simple and the control scheme can be applied across devices. UI and layout might need some adjusting, but this is a minor issue.

## Game Lenses

### Lens of Flow

*Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?*

Yes, the game has a clear goal. It is not that clear how or if the player should try to reach the secret hole.

*Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?*

Yes, the goal is to complete the level before any of your friends and get the highest score.

*Do parts of the game distract players so they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?*

The road to the normal hole is very clear-cut and easy to understand, however it is not clear as to why or how the player is supposed to reach the secret hole.

*Does my game provide a steady stream of gradually increasing challenges?*

As of now the game is very simplistic and it has not been described clearly how the difficulty progresses.

*Are the player's skills improving as expected? If not, how can I change that?*

It is not clearly explained how the player's skills are supposed to progress, i.e. only one level has been described not the future progression. 
- How does the math get more difficult? 
- How does the game get more difficult? 
- What skills is the player supposed to learn?

### Lens of Skill

*What skills does my game require from the player?*

The game requires a basic understanding of lineair equations and how they work. The player does not have to have much knowledge regarding games as the gameplay itself is very simplistic.

*Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?*

The game is very simplistic, and it is unsure of how it can/will be expanded upon. 

*Which skills are dominant?*

It is vital that the player can see the entire course whenever they'd like so they can adjust the function properly. The player most likely has to have a good idea about how the ball is going to bounce of from the walls of the course and can properly estimate at what angle the ball needs to hit the wall. So in short it's best if the player has a keen eye and a good gut feeling.

*Are these skills creating the experience I want?*

Yes, these skills are allowing the player to reach a higher score and compete with their friends.

*Are some players much better at these skills than others?*

Yes there is likely to be a difference in skills between students, in how they perform math, and how good they are at estimating the right angle/power.

*Does this make the game feel unfair?*


*Can players improve their skills with practice?*

*Does this game demand the right level of skill?*

### Concept Dependent Lenses

## Dynamics & Aesthetics

*Are the proposed aesthetics achieved with the current mechanics? Do the dynamics support the aesthetics? Do you agree with the proposed explanation in the GDD?* 

- **Challenge**: Game as obstacle course
  > The game needs to provide a challenge to the students. They need the option of competing with each other.
  The game presents a golf course where all the students can play with each other. They don't compete with each other directly as they cannot influence each others shots / balls, instead they compete in 3 different categories for the title. Even for players who are struggling with the game there is help in form of friends who can help them make it after they finished their round. The challenge can be increased with harder courses, adding to that the player can never shoot straight up or down due to the nature of linear equations.

- **Fellowship**: Game as social framework 
  > The game needs to connect the students in the classroom. A feeling of comradery or chaos should be present.
  The game fosters a social framework because it will be played in the classroom where, like kahoot!. It is the part to all the students look forward to because they can relax for a moment and play a game, the same feeling can be evoked with this game. It is even stronger because all the players sit in one room instead of the usual solo gaming experience, where you play online with friends who might not even be in the same country as the player. There is also the possibility to help your friends if they struggle with their put, which also plays into the social framework.

- **Discovery**: Game as uncharted territory
  > The game needs to let players discover. For those who want to explore deeper than the surface.
  There are options to explore, but the implementation does not tap into the full potential this idea has. There are secret holes that the players can explore and finish the level this way. There is a feeling of discovery attached to that but it can be explored more.
