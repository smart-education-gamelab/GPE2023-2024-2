# DED Discussion Feedback

- Instead of destroying the tower it can be infected by the bloomer disease.

## Scalability

- Write it down in more detail
	- towers placed, but need to pay to unlock towers (intro level).

## Authorability

- Describe better
	- Score based?
	- Place towers upfront?

## Progression

- Describe in more detail.
- Mathematics difficulty:
	- could give an example as to how tables can be implemented.

## Accessibility

- High end graphics: might not be the best option for a web-based game.

## Team Design Value

- Game is detached from the mathematical knowledge (not adjusting the function, but the muzzle).

## Lenses

- Towers limited?
- Stronger sense of presence for the player character (not seen often -> we don't care about it).

## Dynamics & Aesthetics

- Direct tactile sense?, more focused on the input of the player. (Actual things you hold and feel, mario sunshine)
- Espression: we don't even see the character.
- Submission: due to the math more active thinking is required. This game is unplayable if you don't really think about the math stuff. Do you play this as a pastime or is it just because you want to play the game?

## Loops

- Failed wave = the wave progression
- Different punishments for the waves -> unclear what happens
- Combos: how does this influence the progress
- Difficulty: more detailed about 'Waves'
- Performance: could be postive, needs a bit more described
- Upgrades: check this loop
- Repairs: positive loop

## Target platform

- is missing

## Game UI

- Start: could change levels into 'play'or 'start'
