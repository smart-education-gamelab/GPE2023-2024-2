# Myth digger: Design Evaluation Template

`v2.1`

## Core Ideas and Values

### Serious Games

**Definition**: A game intending on teaching the player a concept or skill applicable in the real world.

The game fulfils the set definition. It teaches the player math concepts and linear functions.

It does so in the following forms:

- Building the railroad, using linear equations to plan the layout of the rails.
- Processing, filling in the right x or y values into the table to fulfil the process.
- Crafting, calculate x and y intercepts to determine where the hammer needs to hit.
  The challenges and exercises are creatively implemented and cover a large basis of knowledge.

Although it works more as a testing environment and less as a "teaching" experience.
It feels a little bit like an improved version of function dungeon I.
Instead of just testing, the tests have been incorporated more into the story, i.e. the above mentioned incorporations of linear equations.

### Content

#### Learning Content

The learning content is incorporated properly, as can be seen in the following:

1. Playing with the fundamental characteristics of a linear function first individually and then in combination.

> Fulfilled, they place the railroad tracks by adjusting the *a* and *b* values of the linear equation.

2. Applying the fundamental characteristics to transform one representation (verbal, graph, formula, table) into another in a playful way.

> Fulfilled, they process the materials by solving a function with the help of a table.

3. Solving quests, tasks and problems involving multiple representations of linear function (verbal, graph, formula, table).

> Fulfilled, multiple representations can be found in the following:
>
> - Building the railroad, using linear equations to plan the layout of the rails.
> - Processing, filling in the right x or y values into the table to fulfil the process.
> - Crafting, calculate x and y intercepts to determine where the hammer needs to hit.

4. Applying properties of linear functions to solve equations in a playful way.

> Fulfilled, the game offers a variety of different ways to solve linear functions, ranging from easy to complex tasks that increase in difficulty the further you progress in the game.

5. Applying the appropriate function representation to solve a question or problem in the game.

> Fulfilled, the features in the game have incorporated different ways to incorporate linear functions. Each of these have been made suitable for the situation, i.e. calculate the intercepts of two lines to hit the right spot during crafting.

#### Game Content

### Scalability

**Definitions**:

- Ability to include and expand on the learning goals.

  - The game has included all five learning goals, i.e. placing railroad tracks, processing and crafting.
  - The game cannot directly be expanded because all the learning goals given by the client are incorporated. There has been no explanation on how the learning goals could be expanded upon, i.e. processing is only going to be tables.
- Ability to scale the content and duration of the game, allowing the client to expand in the future.

  - The game could be extended in the future for example with a more diverse variety of materials, harder enemy waves in the caves etc.

### Adaptability

**Definition**: How well is the product able to be used in different situations, e.g. it can be used in the curriculum in multiple ways.

Myth digger is a game most suited for playing in your free time or in a designated lesson in which you only play this game. In case that it has been used for a lesson it cannot be done often due to the nature of the game. The game is not level based and to complete the whole game it takes a long time.

### Difficulty

#### Game Difficulty

**Definition**: The level of challenge the game content presents.

Yes, the game offers an easy introduction and will get more difficult the longer you play, which keeps the gameplay experience interesting.

> @TriangledRat and @Weelum-sama, the general idea has been described, however we are not sure how this progress is made more difficult over time.

#### Mathematics Difficulty

**Definition**: The level of challenge the learning content presents.

*Only and only if* the game has to start with the player placing the railroads.

From easy to hard:

- Altering the function: By visualizing this process in the placement of the railroad track it's easy to see how this works/is implemented.
- Processing: Calculating and filling in the table.
- Crafting: Calculating the x/y intercept in order to define the hammer placement.

After this the process will look like: Place railroads -> Mining -> Processing -> Crafting -> Place railroads

> @TriangledRat and @Weelum-sama: you need to clarify if the game starts with the placement of the railroads. And if not, with what does the player start. If they start with the railroad, they would need to already have some pre-crafted railroads?

> The progression of the game needs to be more clarified, what makes this game doable?
> Once again the general idea has been described well, however we are not sure how the equations get more difficult over time.

### Accessibility

**Definition**: The player can play the game regardless of their mathematical skills, game skills and hardware.

- Mathematical skills: this game can pose quite a challenge for someone who is not/slightly familiar with linear equations. See: Difficulty -> Mathematics difficulty.
- Gameplay skills: as long as the introduction of the controls is clearly stated, the game can be played even by inexperienced gamers.
- Hardware: the game is intended to be played on web, so the hardware is not a big focus. As long as they have a browser, they are able to play the game.

### Core Values

#### Client Design Values

- Gameplay is entertainment first, education second

  - The idea is very story/design/art heavy, however due to the implementation of the math stuff it kind off feels like a testing environment (Like function dungeon I >:D ).
- Complexity around linear functions is scalable

  - Complexity is scalable because the functions are implemented directly which gives a lot of options to increase the challenge.
- Gameplay needs to be validated through play tests by external players

  - Yes
- Target audience, aged 12 to 16, level VWO

  - This game is more suitable for those aged above 13 and like to play games (gamers).
- Gameplay is adaptable so it can be used inside and outside of the classroom

  - Myth Digger is better used outside of the classroom. The game is not suited for a casual play when there are 10min left in the class, but more for a planned lesson of only playing this game.
- Game needs to be designed for web

  - Layout wise the game has been designed for web, i.e. all sketches etc. have been based on it.
- Authorability should be a key element

  - x

### Team Design Values

- Linear algebra has to be incorporated in the design of the core gameplay loop

  - In myth digger it can be found in mechanics, i.e. placing tracks, processing, crafting.
- Fun has to be considered over education in design

  - The concept is very story heavy, which is good for a finished game, but our prototype will be very education heavy.
- The game develops an understanding of the algebra it attempts to teach

  - The game does not really teaches the player the algebra, but is perfect for students who already have a bit of knowledge and want to strengthen their knowledge.
- Accessible and designed to be easy to pick up

  - The game requires a bit more knowledge on how to play it and how everything works, but it is easy to pick up. So this won't present itself as a problem.
- Concept is scalable in complexity

  - Due to the infinite nature of the game, i.e. discovering new caves, the game has great possibilities for future ideas (be it in difficulty or content).
- Game needs to be designed for web

  - Yes

## Game Lenses

- [7] The Lens of Endogenous Value

  - What is valuable to the players in my game?

    - The collected resources that help the player to go deeper and explore more of the caves and then eventually slay the dragon.
    - Exploring new and fresh areas which bring new collectables, enemies and environments.
    - Progressing in the game, slaying the dragon and completing the game.
  - How can I make it more valuable to them?

    - Add a variety in general, and specifically in resources, collectables, enemies and environments.
    - Progress wise, you could add a progressbar which shows how far down in the cave you are and how much further you have to go to reach the dragon.
  - What is the relationship between value in the game and the players' motivations?

    - They want to progress and slay the dragon, there has to be enough content and challenge for gamers to keep coming back.
    - Discoveries have to add something to the game, they have to give the player a fresh feeling (like *[WOOOOW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxtD2p_87as)*).
- [21]  The Lens of Flow

  - Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?

    - The general goals have been described pretty well such as mine resources, process resources and crafting. However it is unclear as to how the player knows what to do in the game.

    > @TriangledRat and @Weelum-sama please give some more elaboration on this.
    >
  - Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?

    - The goals of us are to teach them math in a fun way. The goal of the player is to learn math but also to progress in the game and there is no clear explanation for him on how to do it.

    > @TriangledRat and @Weelum-sama this can differ due to the first question of the *Flow* lens, please explain a bit more if it's still unclear.
    >
  - Do parts of the game distract players so they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?

    - No, there are no side quests or anything that could distract them of the goal.
    - The math can be distracting, because the player wants to slay the dragon and the solving of the equations and math feels more like an obstacle to them. Aside from the placement of the tracks, it almost feels like a better version of Function Dungeon. This is due to the fact that in order to integrate the equations in a more subtle manner, the game is quite heavily dependent on stuff like art-style, sound, music, particles etc.
  - Does my game provide a steady stream of gradually increasing challenges?

    - Yes, the game gives different exercises with various degrees of challenge.
      - For crafting and processing the difficulty is mostly centered around the linear equations.
      - Enemies can get progressively more difficult to fight over time (per cave).

    > @TriangledRat and @Weelum-sama how do you guys envision the rise in challenge? Is there going to be more difficulties during exploring or does every action stay the same (i.e. equations get more difficult and enemies get stronger, but no new ways to explore the cave or different cave layouts etc.)? Please explain in more detail. In the Dynamics it has been described that it gets more difficult but not really how, i.e. what does the player need to do? walk around it? throw a bomb? how does this make it more challenging?
    >
  - Are the player's skills improving as expected? If not, how can I change that?

    - *We don't know, needs to be tested*
    - Assumption: The players skill (math and gameplay related) are improving over the course the game, simply due to repeating the gameplay loop over and over again.

    > @TriangledRat and @Weelum-sama this question is difficult to answer, because we don't really know how/if the player needs to improve for fighting the monsters, exploring new caves etc.
    >

> Our goal: To teach math topics in a fun game.

> Player goal: Reach the dragon to kill it.

- [55] Lens of Visible Progress

  - What does it mean to make progress in my game?

    - Decent deeper into the cave, get more resources, defeat enemies and slay the dragon.
  - Is there enough progress in my game? Is there a way I can add more interim steps of progressive success?

    - Yes, the general gist of progress is there.
    - Yes, there are possible additions which can be made to the game these are not required as of now.
  - What progress is visible, and what progress is hidden? Can I find a way to reveal what is hidden?

    - The progress of the excavation of the cave is visible but the progress on the way to slay the dragon is hidden. There is no way, as of currently, to know how far along are you on your way down to the dragon's lair.

    > @TriangledRat and @Weelum-sama, progress wise you could add a progressbar which shows how far down in the cave you are and how much further you have to go to reach the dragon.
    >
- [69] The Lens of Interest Curve

  - If I draw an interest curve of my experience, how is it shaped?

    - Start game: high interest, because they want to get going and discover the whole game
    - Mid game: interest dips, because gameplay gets repetitive with mining, coming back up, process and crafting all the things and go back down to do it all again. If they encounter enemies the interest shoots back up.
      - Discover cave: high interest (my new shiny cave)
      - Mining: in the beginning it's high, and when it gets repetitive the player is less motivated
      - Processing and crafting: in the beginning it's mid, and when it gets repetitive the player is less motivated
    - End game: interest at a low, game is repetitive, if they do reach a boss (the dragon) interest is back up.
  - Doest it have a hook?

    - Yes, at the end you get to slay a dragon, minecraft style.
  - Is there gradually rising interest, punctuated by periods of rest?

    - It's not gradually rising, it is levelling until you encounter the dragon and then the interest is back up.

    > @TriangledRat and @Weelum-sama, this depends on how well the player is guided and if they can see their progress.
    >
  - Is there a grand finale, more interesting than everything else?

    - Yes, there is the dragon at the end of the game.
  - What changes would give me a better interest curve?

    - The integration of not only different tunnels but also different types of bioms within these tunnels. So that the player can always look forward to discover a deeper layer with new resources and enemy types.

    > @TriangledRat and @Weelum-sama is there one cave per layer? or are there multiple? if there are multiple are there any differences between the caves? How do you get deeper? Do you need to make the elevator shaft deeper?
    >
  - Is there a fractural structure to my interest curve?

    - Not particularly. This fact ties back to the repetitiveness of the gameplay. It could solved by implementing different bioms or enemies (which you have granted, the enemies that is) etc.

    > See the first question of: The Lens of Interest Curve.
    >
  - Do my intuitions about the interest curve match the observed interest of the players? If I ask playtesters to draw an interest cure, what does it look like?

    - *We cannot answer this question as of now*
- ~~38 The Lens of Challenge~~
- ~~51 The Lens of Imagination~~
- ~~83 The Lens of Fantasy~~

## Dynamics & Aesthetics

- **Fantasy**: Game as make believe

The fantasy aspect is incorporated within all mechanics. Especially with mining for ressources, exploring the caves and encountering enemies that you need to defeat.
The idea on how to incorporate processing and crafting does give a fantasy like feel, but due to the mathematics this feeling does not fully support *fantasy*.

@TriangledRat and @Weelum-sama: Processing and crafting depend too much on the Art, Story and Design stuff, so we cannot fully judge this part yet.

- **Challenge**: Game as obstacle course

The mining part is simple and relatively easy to understand, the harder part is the placing of the tracks. Here the challenge of the math comes in and the understanding of how to best place the tracks. The player can explore the caves and encounters enemies which also play into the challenge. The processing and crafting are both math based and are dependant on how hard the math questions are or how good the player is at math.

All-in-all the game allows for some easy gameplay and some difficult gameplay which supports the aesthetic: *Challenge*.

- **Discovery**: Game as uncharted territory

The need to find and navigate ore tunnels gives the player a sense of exploration (discovery). Further supported by the idea that multiple resources have to be scavenged from the cave(s). This is all a result from the combination of the mechanics and dynamics. The progression is such that the player is always focused on exploring and/or discovering something new.

In short the game is mostly centered around and focused on the aesthetic of *Discovery*.
