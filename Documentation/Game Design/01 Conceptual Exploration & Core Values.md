# Conceptual Exploration & Core Ideas

This document outlines which mutual understanding and values we, and the client, uphold regarding game design. It is important to have a shared understanding of the core concepts and ideas that we are working with. This document will be used as a reference point for the team to ensure that we are all on the same page.

## Conceptual Exploration

### Serious Games

A game intending on teaching the player a concept or skill applicable in the real world.

### Learning Goals

A statement of what the student should know or be able to do as the result of a learning experience.

### Content

We divide content into two subgroups:

#### Learning Content

The learning goals and mathematical aspects.

#### Game Content

The narrative, art, sound and gameplay.

### Scalability

The following definitions are applicable to our project:

- Ability to include and expand on the learning goals.
- Ability to scale the content and duration of the game, allowing the client to expand in the future.

### Adaptability

How well is the product able to be used in different situations, e.g. it can be used in the curriculum in multiple ways.

### Difficulty

In our project, we divide difficulty into two subgroups:

#### Game Difficulty

The level of challenge the game content presents.

#### Mathematical Difficulty

The level of challenge the learning content presents.

### Accessibility

The player can play the game regardless of their mathematical skills, game skills and hardware.

### Authorability

Teachers being able to modify or build their own levels, aka authored user generated content.

## Core Values

### Client Design Values

- Gameplay is entertainment first, education second
- Complexity around linear functions is scalable
- Gameplay needs to be validated through play tests by external players
- Target audience, aged 12 to 16, level VWO
- Gameplay is adaptable so it can be used inside and outside of the classroom
- Game needs to be designed for web
- Authorability should be a key element

### Team Design Values

- Linear algebra has to be incorporated in the design of the core gameplay loop
- Fun has to be considered over education in design
- The game develops an understanding of the algebra it attempts to teach
- Accessible and designed to be easy to pick up
- Concept is scalable in complexity
- Game needs to be designed for web

### Conflicting Values

The client value on authorability is in conflict with the project context, but should be kept in mind in the design stages. It will most likely not be implemented in the final prototype.
