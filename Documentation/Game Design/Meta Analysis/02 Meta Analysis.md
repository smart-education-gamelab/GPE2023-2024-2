# Engaging & Involving: A Meta-Analysis of Game-Based Learning for Linear Equations

> By team Burning Equations at AUAS

## Abstract

This paper explores the effectiveness of game-based learning (GBL) in teaching linear equations to secondary education students, as part of the GAMMA project under the Erasmus+ Programme. The project focuses on the development and evaluation of six game concepts: Angry Equations, Myth Digger, Mushroom of Bloom, Kaiju Killer, Architect of Goo, and Slope Swing. These games were designed using a structured framework grounded in Design Thinking principles, aiming to balance engagement and educational value.

The heuristic evaluation and user testing of the game concepts revealed varying degrees of success. Kaiju Killer emerged as the most promising concept, demonstrating high alignment with core values and effective integration of didactic content. User testing Angry Equations and Myth Digger, also showed positive results, particularly in engaging players and incorporating linear functions into gameplay.

Key findings indicate the importance of integrating mathematical content seamlessly into game mechanics, ensuring accessibility, and designing for scalability and adaptability. The study recommends enhancing the integration of didactics in gameplay, focusing on scalability, and providing immediate feedback on problem-solving.

This research highlights the potential of GBL in enhancing mathematical learning and provides insights for future development and refinement of educational games. Limitations of the study include the small sample size for user testing and the need for real-world classroom implementation to validate findings. Future research should aim to address these limitations and further explore the balance between engagement and educational impact in game-based learning.

## I. Introduction

### A. Background

Since 2020, the GAMMA project under the Erasmus+ Programme has been dedicated to implementing Game-Based Learning (GBL) to enhance students' mathematical knowledge and skills. During the project's duration, multiple games have been developed, each focusing on a different mathematical topic:

| Game             | MathematicalÂ Concept                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Balloon          | Derivatives                            |
| Function Dungeon | Linear Functions                       |
| ProbChallenge    | Probability                            |
| E(qua)scape Room | System of Linear Equation              |
| Hot-Air Balloon  | Direct Proportion & Inverse Proportion |
| Yo-Yo Bird       | Trigonometric Functions                |
| GeomWiz          | Geometry                               |

### B. Function Dungeon

One of the project partners, the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS), developed the game Function Dungeon, which focuses on linear equations. This game targets upper secondary education students aged 12-16, this target when placed in context of the Dutch Education system, are students in years 2 to 4 at HAVO & VWO level.

In the paper "Fostering Joyful Practice with Digital Educational Games: The Function Dungeon Game" by AUAS, the game is described as follows:

> In Function Dungeon the player is an explorer trying to find a way through the dungeon. In order to accomplish this game goal, the player has to traverse through a labyrinth of different rooms. Many rooms are originally locked so it is up to the players to find a way to open them. The players can achieve this by interacting with different objects in the rooms. This will allow them to find function-related problems hidden throughout the rooms. Solving these problems will in turn open the way to other rooms. While exploring the players can make friends by bringing hidden objects to Non-Playable Characters (NPC: a character in a computer game that is not controlled by someone playing the game).

> The main educational goal of the game is to provide students with an opportunity to practice with and learn about linear functions in an appealing and engaging gaming environment. The game is designed to help students strengthen their understanding of the (fundamental) characteristics of linear functions in different representations: textual, numerical, graphical, and analytical.

The paper further evaluates the game's effectiveness through testing and analysis and the findings suggest:

> That the Function Dungeon is an engaging game that helps students master linear functions by allowing them to control their learning pace, choose levels, and receive optional feedback, enhancing both fun and educational value. While players can advance without solving all tasks, they must complete most to progress, with limited, brief feedback available for incorrect answers.

The game content analysis concludes:

> [That] students had the feeling that they learn mathematics with the game. A close analysis of the game shows that the main mechanics in the game (solving math questions) do not differ much from the traditional practice (answering questions from the book or teacher). The exception is the coordinates task, which involves secondary mechanics.

For future development, the paper recommends:

> One way to improve the game is to implement other kinds of mechanics that directly involve the player in the mathematics. Also, aspects of collaboration, problem-solving and social-scientific issues are currently not addressed in the game. In addition, the game should not be presented as a stand-alone activity, but it should be integrated by the teacher with other classroom activities.

### C. Research Problem

The identified research problem is:

> How can the didactic content of linear equations be translated into a game that is both engaging and educational, while directly involving the player in the mathematics?

This paper argues that designing game mechanics that directly involve the player in mathematics will enhance engagement and educational value. Six new game concepts will be developed and evaluated against context-aware criteria to determine the most effective in addressing the research problem. The paper will also discuss the implications of the results and suggest avenues for further exploration.

## II. Design Framework

The design framework used for developing the six concepts is a systematic approach to the development of game designs that are both engaging and educational. It is based on `Design Thinking` [^1] and is guided by five key principles: `Empathy`, `Flexibility`, `Simplicity`, `Evaluation`, and `Collaboration`. These principles underpin every stage of the development process, from the initial concept to the final testing phase. The framework is divided into four distinct stages: `Concept`, `Design`, `Implementation`, and `Test`. Each stage involves specific activities and produces tangible outcomes that contribute to the overall development of the game.

### A. Principles

The key principles at the base of the design framework are:

1. `Empathy`: Understand the player's perspective.
2. `Flexibility`: Be open to changes.
3. `Simplicity`: Avoid over-complication.
4. `Evaluation`: Continuously analyse and reflect.
5. `Collaboration`: Encourage teamwork.

These principles are distilled from several design thinking methodologies [^1] [^2] [^3] and are essential for guiding the development. By incorporating these principles into the development process, the framework aims to foster creativity, innovation, and user-centred design.

### B. Process

The design process is divided into four stages: `Concept`, `Design`, `Implementation`, and `Test`. Each stage includes specific products and processes to achieve its goals. The process progresses from high-level design to detailed implementation and ends with heuristic evaluation and user testing.

### C. Core Values

An important aspect of the design framework is the definition of core values that guide the development of the game concepts. These values underpin every aspect of the design process and ensure that the games meet both educational and entertainment goals. The core values are:

| Code | Core Value                             | Description                                                                                                           |

| CV10 | Consideration of Authorability         | Factor in the ease of content creation and modification during design stages to allow for customisation and updates   |

### D. Learning Goals

To guide the didactics of the concepts, specific learning goals have been used. The learning goals are the same as used in the Function Dungeon game [^4] and provide a clear direction for the educational content of the games. The learning goals are:

| Code | Goal                                                            | Description                                                                                                    |
|:----:| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## III. Heuristic Evaluation

During the test phase of the design process, the game concepts are evaluated using a heuristic evaluation method. The method assesses the quality and project alignment of the game concepts against predefined criteria which can be found in `Appendix B`. For this paper, the model has been adapted to suit the context of the research problem and a scoring system has been implemented to quantify the results.

### A. Criteria

The model has been distilled into the following criteria based on the research problem:

| Code | Criteria             | Description                                                                                                                 |
|:----:|:-------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HE1  | Core Value Alignment | The extent to which the game concept aligns with the core values defined in the design framework                            |
| HE2  | Didactic Content     | The effectiveness of integrating educational material within the game to meet learning objectives                           |
| HE3  | Didactic Difficulty  | The appropriateness of the mathematical difficulty level for the target audience and learning goals                         |
| HE4  | Game Content         | The quality and inclusion of narrative, art, sound, and level design within the game                                        |
| HE5  | Game Difficulty      | The level of challenge presented by the game content and its alignment with the target audience                             |
| HE6  | Scalability          | The potential for the game to scale in complexity and content to adapt to multiple learning goals and future expansions     |
| HE7  | Adaptability         | The game's ability to adapt to different educational settings                                                               |
| HE8  | Accessibility        | The ease with which players can access and play the game regardless of their mathematical skills, game skills, and hardware |

> Describe which criteria have been combined or split up and why

### B. Scoring

To quantify the evaluation results for this paper, a scoring system has been implemented:

#### 1. Core Value Alignment (HE1)

For `HE1`, a scale of 0 to 10 is used to score the alignment of the game concept with the core values. A score of 0 indicates no alignment, while a score of 10 indicates perfect alignment. Each point is based on whether a core value is fully met or not.

#### 2. Didactic Content (HE2)

For `HE2`, a scale of 0 to 5 is used to score the effectiveness of integrating educational material within the game. A score of 0 indicates no integration, while a score of 5 indicates full integration, and this is based on how many learning goals are fully incorporated.

#### 3. Remaining Criteria (HE3 - HE8)

For `HE3`, `HE4`, `HE5`, `HE6`, `HE7`, and `HE8`, the criteria are scaled using `Negative (-1)`, `Neutral (0)`, and `Positive (1)` scores. Negative scores indicate a lack of alignment with the criteria, Neutral scores indicate partial alignment, and Positive scores indicate full alignment.

### C. Sentimental Analysis

To achieve the scores of `HE3`, `HE4`, `HE5`, `HE6`, `HE7`, and `HE8`, a sentimental analysis is performed using ChatGPT 4o(mni) [^5] [^6] on the evaluation results to determine the alignment of the game concepts with the criteria. Per concept a new conversation is started with the following prompt:

`I am going to give you pieces of text and you need to tell me whether the sentiment is negative, neutral or positive`

After which the evaluation results per criteria are fed into the model to determine the sentiment of the evaluation results. The results from the analysis are then quantified using the scoring system defined above to provide a clear overview of the evaluation outcomes.

## IV. User Testing

Besides heuristic evaluation, user testing has been conducted on three of the six concepts to evaluate the game's effectiveness. The user testing process involved observing players as they interacted with the game concepts and collecting feedback on their experience. The results of the user testing were used to identify key areas for improvement and test design assumptions. 

### A. Process

The user testing process created the following products in the defined order:

1. `User Test Plan`: Outlines the specific data that will be collected during user testing and the methods that will be used to collect this data.

2. `User Test Data Model`: Organizes and structures the data that will be collected during user testing. It provides a framework for collecting data in a consistent manner. 

3. `User Test Results`: Is the raw data collected during user testing, including observations, feedback, and other relevant information.

4. `User Test Report`:  Summarizes the results of user testing, and provides an analysis of the collected data with insights and recommendations for each concept. 

The process is visualized in the flowchart below:

> The blocks are products, while the arrows and trapezoids are processes.

### B. Methodology

#### 1. Tools

For user testing the following tools are used for data collection and analysis:

- `Microsoft Forms`: For collecting the data & performing different types of analyses[^9]
- `Visual Studio Code`: For developing the data models & writing down the findings

#### 2. Collection & Analysis

To make sure our data is collected digitally and can be easily analysed, `Microsoft Forms` is used. This means each concept's `User Test Data Model` is turned into a `Microsoft Form` before the test is performed. To make sure the player isn't bothered by the form, an observer fills it during the user test. To perform the test, there should be at least 2 people present:

- A `test conductor` to guide the player through the game & test
- An `observer` who will oversee the test and fill in the form

Once the data is collected, the data is analysed inside of `Microsoft Forms` using the responses view. 

##### a. Quantitative

For quantitative data, the numbers and percentages of the responses are interpreted based on the benchmarks defined in the `User Test Plan`.

##### b. Qualitative

For qualitative data, the methodology will depend on the number of responses:

- `9 or less`: The individual responses are interpreted individually to decide on the overall sentiment of the players and find insightful keywords and phrases.

- `10 or more`: The built-in word cloud tool is used to select insightful keywords and phrases, and to decide on the overall sentiment of the players.

- `20 or more`: The sentimental analysis tool is used to decide on the overall sentiment of the players in combination with the word clouds to select insightful keywords and phrases.

#### 3. Limitations & Justification

These methods are highly sensitive to interpretation and are therefore easily influenced by the personal bias of the person interpreting the data. To mitigate this, we will be using a team approach to interpreting the data. This means that at least 2 team members will be interpreting the data and discussing their findings to come to a consensus.

The tools and methods chosen, are based on the time constraints and need for a digital data collection method. Our qualitative analysis methods are based on the built-in tools provided by `Microsoft Forms`[^10].

### C. Criteria

The criteria used to asses the user testing results are based on the HBOi Domain Description [^7], Game Flow [^8] and core values defined in the design framework:

| Code | Criteria          | Description                                                                                                            |
|:----:| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UT1  | Functionality     | The extent to which the prototype functions as intended and hinders or supports the user experience                    |
| UT2  | User Experience   | The overall experience of the user while interacting with the game concept                                             |
| UT3  | Accessibility     | The extent in which the prototype is accessible to a wide range of users                                               |
| UT4  | Didactic Efficacy | The advancement and development of knowledge, skills, and capabilities over time within an educational context         |
| UT5  | Game Flow         | The seamless and engaging progression of gameplay experienced by the player throughout their interaction with the game |

The generic metrics & benchmarks for each criteria can be found in `Appendix C`, while the test plan & data model with applicable & transformed metrics & benchmarks for each concept can be found in `Appendix D`.

### D. Scoring

The collected data per concept is varying in nature, ranging from qualitative feedback to quantitative observations. The data itself is also different per concept, as the user testing process is tailored to the specific game concept, but all data collected falls within the criteria defined above. Per criteria, a score is given based on the percentage of users that experienced issues or had a positive experience.

> `N%`: Number of users that experienced issues / Number of users that participated in the user test

## V. Concepts

The following sections will present the six game concepts developed for the research problem. For each concept a description of the concept will be given, after which it will be discussed how the didactics of linear functions is integrated into the mechanics. Finally, the design characteristics will be outlined to better understand the game's place in the design space in regards to the other concepts.

The full game design documents for each concept can be found in `Appendix E`.

### A. C1 Angry Equations

#### 1. Description

In Angry Equations, the player takes on the role of a monkey whose bananas have been stolen by mischievous raccoons. The player's mission is to use linear functions to fire projectiles from a cannon to destroy structures and defeat the raccoons. The game combines elements of destruction and strategy, encouraging players to learn and apply the fundamental characteristics of linear functions to progress through increasingly challenging levels.

#### 2. Mechanics & Didactics

##### a. Aim

- The core mechanic involves aiming the cannon by adjusting the values of a linear function in the form of `y = ax + b`. 
- The player manipulates the slope (`a`) and intercept (`b`) to change the trajectory of the projectile.
- This mechanic allows players to engage with the fundamental properties of linear functions directly.

##### b. Destruct

- The goal is to destroy structures and defeat raccoons by strategically aiming the projectiles.

## VI. Design Space Analysis

To get a better overview of where the concepts are placed against each other in terms of their design characteristics, a design space analysis is conducted. This analysis will provide insights into the unique design elements of each concept and how they relate to each other. The analysis is divided into two categories: `Game Design` and `User Interaction`.

### A. Game Design

| C1                      | C2        | C3                  | C4                  | C5                    | C6            |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| Interactive Environment | Narrative | Resource Management | Interactive Puzzles | Environmental Puzzles | Competition   |
| Strategy                | Immersion | Strategy            | Self-expression     | Exploration           | Collaboration |

Each concept has unique design characteristics that set them apart from the others and offer different experiences to players. However, some concepts share similar design elements, such as strategy for `C1` Angry Equations and `C3` Mushroom of Bloom, and Puzzle Solving for `C4` Kaiju Killer and `C5` Architect of Goo.

|                             | C1  | C2  | C3  | C4  | C5  | C6  |
| --------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adjustment using Buttons    | x   | x   | x   |     | x   | x   |
| Direct Input                |     | x   | x   | x   | x   |     |
| Choosing the Correct Option |     | x   |     |     |     |     |
| Choosing the Best Option    |     |     | x   |     |     |     |

The way the player interacts with the game is also unique for each concept, but there is a presence of adjusting values using buttons in `C1`, `C2`, `C3`, `C5`, and `C6`. For most concepts this element is applied to `LG1`, as it gives the player an intuitive way to interact with the mathematical content and learn through experimentation.

## VII. Multi-Criteria Analysis

To better understand the strengths and weaknesses of each game concept, a multi-criteria analysis is conducted. The analysis compares the concepts based on the heuristic evaluation and user testing results to determine which concepts are most effective in addressing the research problem. The results are presented in a visual format to provide a clear overview of the findings.

### A. Evaluation Results

## VIII. Conclusion

The implementation of Game-Based Learning (GBL) for enhancing students' understanding of mathematical concepts, specifically linear equations, has demonstrated potential through the Function Dungeon game developed by the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS). However, while Function Dungeon has been effective in engaging students, there is a notable opportunity for improvement in integrating didactic content more seamlessly into the gameplay. This paper has addressed the research problem of translating didactic content into an engaging and educational game by developing six new game concepts.

The proposed game concepts of Angry Equations, Myth Digger, Mushroom of Bloom, Kaiju Killer, Architect of Goo, and Slope Swing, each offer unique mechanics aimed at involving players directly in mathematical problem-solving. These concepts were developed using a structured design framework based on Design Thinking principles, which emphasised empathy, flexibility, simplicity, evaluation, and collaboration. The framework ensured that the game designs remained user-centred and educationally effective.

### A. Key Findings

1. `Engagement and Educational Value`:
   
    The evaluation of the six game concepts through heuristic analysis and user testing revealed varying degrees of success in terms of engagement and educational value. Kaiju Killer emerged as the most promising concept, demonstrating a high level of alignment with core values and effective integration of educational content. Through user testing, Angry Equations and Myth Digger also showed affirmative results, with Myth Digger being particularly effective in engaging players and integrating didactic content.

2. `Mechanics and Didactics`:
   
    Games like Angry Equations and Myth Digger effectively incorporated linear functions into their core mechanics, providing players with opportunities to practice and apply mathematical concepts in a fun and interactive environment. However, concepts such as Slope Swing faced challenges in maintaining a balance between fun and educational rigour.

3. `User Experience and Accessibility`:
   
    User testing indicated that games with intuitive controls and clear interfaces, such as Angry Equations, received positive feedback in terms of user experience. Conversely, games that required more complex interactions, like Myth Digger, faced accessibility challenges that need to be addressed to ensure broader usability.

4. `Scalability and Adaptability`:
   
    The analysis also highlighted the importance of designing games that are scalable and adaptable to different educational settings. Concepts that allowed for progressive difficulty, such as Mushroom of Bloom, were better received as they could cater to a range of skill levels and learning paces.

### B. Recommendations

1. `Enhanced Integration of Mechanics and Didactics`:
   
    Future game designs should strive to more deeply integrate mathematical content into the core mechanics, ensuring that the educational objectives are met through engaging gameplay. This can be achieved to a greater extent by providing immediate feedback on mathematical problem-solving and creating more opportunities for players to apply linear functions in diverse contexts over text-book-like questions.

2. `Scalability and Modularity`:
   
    Designing games with scalable complexity and modular content can allow for expansion and customization, making the games suitable for a wider range of educational contexts and learning objectives, as can be seen in Mushroom of Bloom and Architect of Goo.

### C. Future Research

The development and evaluation of the six game concepts have provided valuable insights into the effective integration of game-based learning for teaching linear equations. By leveraging a structured design framework and incorporating feedback from heuristic evaluations and user testing, this research has identified key areas for improvement and innovation in educational game design. The findings underscore the importance of balancing fun and educational value, ensuring accessibility, and fostering user-centered design to create engaging and effective learning experiences. Future research and development should continue to explore these avenues, with the aim of enhancing the educational impact of game-based learning in mathematics.

## IX. Limitations

This study's limitations include the small sample size for user testing and the focus on a specific age group and educational context. Future studies should aim to include a larger and more diverse sample to validate the findings and recommendations. Additionally, while the heuristic evaluation provides valuable insights, real-world classroom implementation and feedback would further enrich the understanding of the games' effectiveness.

### A. Framework

Acknowledgement should also be given to the limitations of the design framework, which may not fully capture the complexity of game development and educational design. Future research should continue to refine and expand the framework to address emerging challenges and opportunities in game-based learning.

### B. Time Constraints

The biggest hindrance to the research was the time frames in which the research was conducted. The time frames were too short to fully develop and test the game concepts, leading to a lack of depth in the evaluation results. Future research should aim to allocate more time for development and testing to ensure a more comprehensive analysis of the game concepts.

### C. Design Space

Additionally, it is important to note that designing effective game mechanics specifically for linear functions inherently limits the scope of the mechanics. If the mechanics are too narrowly focused on linear functions, they may not fully capture the depth and variety of the mathematical concepts. Conversely, if the mechanics are broadened to cover more content, they may become more superficial and less effective at teaching linear functions. This balance is a critical challenge in the development of educational games and requires careful consideration and iterative testing to optimise both engagement and educational value.
