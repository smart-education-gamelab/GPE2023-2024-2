# Meta Analysis: Approach

Meta analysis is the process of analysing the analysis. In the context of game design, meta analysis involves analysing the analysis of the design space of a game. This can involve looking at the results of previous design analyses, comparing them to each other, and drawing conclusions about the design space of the game.

## Project Context

In our process we analyse our games in two ways, one using our Design Evaluation Document (`DED`) and the other using our User Testing Report (`UTR`).

- The `DED` is a document that reflects the design of our concepts, and evaluates them against a set of criteria: `Content`, `Scalability`, `Adaptability`, `Difficulty`, `Accessibility`, and project context. Apart from these criteria we use the `DED` to explore and affirm the design space of our game using the Game Lenses. All in all is the `DED` used to assess the quality of our designs, and to identify areas for improvement based on the design space of the game.
- The `UTR` is a report that outlines the results of user testing set within the five key areas we identified as important for our project: `Functionality`, `Accessibility`, `User Experience`, `Didactic Efficacy`, and `Game Flow`.

## Approach

For our meta analysis we quantify and compare the concepts against each other using our criteria from the `DED` and `UTR`. This allows us to identify patterns and trends in the design space of our game, and to draw conclusions about the quality of our designs. This means our meta analysis will be based on the following criteria:

- `Content`
- `Scalability`
- `Adaptability`
- `Difficulty`
- `Accessibility`
- `Functionality`
- `User Experience`
- `Didactic Efficacy`
- `Game Flow`

## Results

Using the quantified results we could provide a visual representation of the design space of our game like a radar chart or a heat map. This would allow us to see at a glance how each concept performs in each area, informing us about which concepts have the most potential for future development and which areas need improvement in our designs.
