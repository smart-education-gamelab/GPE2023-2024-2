## Concept 1: Angry Equations

### Core Ideas and Values

#### Serious Games

**Definition**: A game intending on teaching the player a concept or skill applicable in the real world.

The game attempts to teach the player linear equations in a very easy to understand way and in a way that is also very closely related to how trajectories impacted by gravity work in real life. The game teaches this concept by having the player aim a cannon to destroy obstacles and enemies. The trajectory of the bullet is impacted by gravity and behaves like a real bullet would. The linear function is hereby tied directly into the gameplay. This game is perfect for the introduction to linear equations as it starts on a very low level and through the simplistic gameplay also has a low entry point for inexperienced gamers. The input system is easy to understand and does not rely on any intricate skills but solely on the cursor. This concept is best used as a parallel to the introduction given by the teacher into linear equations and functions. 

This game copies the functionality of Angry Birds, a widely known game with a simple premise. The players are guaranteed a interesting yet simple experience which they have seen before and are familiar with.

#### Content

##### Learning Content

The learning content has been partially met. The concept is very small and only describes one way to interact with the mathematical aspect. The progression of the mathematical aspect and the gameplay with mechanics is missing and therefore the learning goals are only partially met:

1. Playing with the fundamental characteristics of a linear function first individually and then in combination.

> Partially fulfilled. The game sets a low bar for the entry level with and lets the player interact with the function in simple way. Letting the player experience how each value works. Although it is not clearly stated how they interact with each other and in the GDD there is no progression of the mathematical and gameplay stated.

2. Applying the fundamental characteristics to transform one representation (verbal, graph, formula, table) into another in a playful way.

> Partially fulfilled. The player can interact with the formula and can see in real time how it translates to a graph. There are no tables implemented though and not described how they would be added to the game.

3. Solving quests, tasks and problems involving multiple representations of linear function (verbal, graph, formula, table).

> Partially fulfilled. The player is solving puzzles and problems with multiple representations of a linear functions, these being a graph and a formula. The concept does not explain how more could be implemented.

4. Applying properties of linear functions to solve equations in a playful way.

> Fulfilled. The gameplay experience is engaging and the way to solve the problem the player has to aim the cannon and shoot. The gameplay is inspired by Angry Birds and it reflects that playfulness.

5. Applying the appropriate function representation to solve a question or problem in the game.

> Partially Fulfilled. The game in this stage only offers one way to represent a function which is from the formula to the graph. It has potential to extend the gameplay experience to other representations as well and incorporate more mechanics.

##### Game Content

*How does the game include narrative, art, sound and further game and or level design?*

The game is very simple and is inspired by angry birds. It functions a lot like that game in multiple ways. The story is very bare bone but could be elaborated on more and worked out to create a good hook and a engaging experience. The artstyle is simple and not too flashy which works perfectly for this simple concept. The sound is not described in detail as well as the animations and particle effects which are lacking, so we cannot make a judgement on that.

#### Scalability

Due to the lack of explanation and description regarding the scalability we cannot make a fair judgement based on the context, and we will not make assumptions. Therefore this section might come across as a bit depressing. The concept in itself is scalable but it is just not described. The concept is also not suited for other types of functions like exponential ones.

*Ability to include and expand on the learning goals.*
- The learning goals are not very well described how they are included in this concept so they can not be expanded on. The expansion is not described in progression. The ability is there, and there is potential in this concept but because of lacking explanation this is hard to judge.

*Ability to scale the content and duration of the game, allowing the client to expand in the future.*
- The content and duration of the game is scalable. The levels can be made harder and there is a skill tree mentioned in the concept which provides a basis to scale this concept. New skills could be added to this tree in the future which impact the gameplay experience. 

#### Adaptability

*Does it align with how the team defined adaptability? Is it an adaptable game? How? Why?*

**Definition**: How well is the product able to be used in different situations, e.g. it can be used in the curriculum in multiple ways.

This concept can be used in multiple different ways. It can be used as a addition to the classroom for a intermission or a exercise at the end of the lesson. Due to the nature of the levels being quite short, this game is perfect for short time slots that need to be filled. It can also be used outside of the classroom as a extracurricular activity or a game that the students play in their free time or as homework. The game cannot be adapted to teach other equations for example exponential ones due to the nature of how it is conceptualised.

#### Difficulty

##### Game Difficulty

**Definition**: The level of challenge the game content presents.

This concept has a very low entry bar and presents itself as perfect for students who are not gamers but also for those who are experienced in this field because it is heavily inspired by angry birds, a very well known game. The game is simple and allows for a nice and easy introduction to linear equations and functions, provided by the simplicity of the mechanic of adjusting the variables of the formula. There is no further description of how the progression works in regards to the game difficulty and if other mechanics will be introduced so we cannot make an informed judgement.

##### Mathematics Difficulty

**Definition**: The level of challenge the learning content presents.

This game starts with a very simple task which allows the player to get familiar with how the different variables interact with each other in the function and how they work together. There is no progression of this concept described in the GDD!

#### Accessibility

**Definition**: The player can play the game regardless of their mathematical skills, game skills and hardware.

- Mathematical skills: this game is very simplistic and has a easy introduction to linear equations and the mathematical aspect. It serves as a very easy entry point for students who just learned about how linear functions work.
- Gameplay skills: the input system is very simple, the player just needs to adjust the function by pressing a button which is very easy to do and requires no prior knowledge of how to play games. So this game is suitable for non gamers as well as hard-core gamer.
- Hardware: the game is intended to be played on web, so the hardware is not a big focus. As long as the player has a browser, they are able to play the game.

#### Core Values

##### Client Design Values

- Gameplay is entertainment first, education second
  - The gameplay is indeed entertainment first. The mathematical aspect is only important in the beginning of each shot, and the player then can see how much destruction they can cause. The gameplay is simple and engaging.

- Complexity around linear functions is scalable
  - This is not described in the concept.

- Gameplay needs to be validated through play tests by external players
  - Guerilla testing was conducted for this concept and further testing is planned with the target audience.

- Target audience, aged 12 to 16, level VWO
  - Yes

- Gameplay is adaptable so it can be used inside and outside of the classroom
  - The gameplay is adaptable and can be used for classroom activities, homework of for the player to play on their own free time.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  - This game is designed for web in mind, and also takes mobile into consideration by having an input system solely based on the cursor / touch with no expensive rendering or calculations.

- Authorability should be a key element
  - This concept is not described as very authorable. The levels need to be built and tested for how good they work because the player destroys them. So this concept is not suitable to be edited by the teachers. There are different variables at play here which work tightly together and should not be edited or altered in any way by the outside.

##### Team Design Values

- Linear algebra has to be incorporated in the design of the core gameplay loop
  - The core gameplay loop is not specifically described but from the texts it can be extracted that the mathematical aspect is deeply tied into the core gameplay loop.

- Fun has to be considered over education in design
  - The game is inspired by Angry Birds and plays very similar which promises an engaging gameplay experience. The nature of the interaction is very much tied into destruction which can be seen as fun by some players.

- The game develops an understanding of the algebra it attempts to teach
  - The game is perfect for an easy introduction into linear algebra, functions and math. It has a very low entry bar and is easy to pick up both in the mechanics but also considering the complexity of the mathematical aspect.

- Accessible and designed to be easy to pick up
  - Fulfilled. The design is very accessible as it only relies on buttons and has a visual component to enhance the understanding of the relation between the formula and the graph. Mechanics-wise it is also very easy to pick up as the mechanic is simple and clear.

- Concept is scalable in complexity
  - The scalability is not described in the concept.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  - The game is designed for web and also kept mobile in mind as well.

### Game Lenses

#### Lens of Flow

*Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?*
- The game has a clear goal, which is to destroy the enemies and collect the bananas. Because it is inspired by Angry Birds and the gameplay are fairly similar it should be easy to pick up as Angry Birds is quite easy to play as well and well known.

*Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?*
- The goals of the player are to destroy the enemies and the structures. The goal of the designers is to teach them math in a fun and engaging way. These two things (the mechanic and the destruction) are so tightly knit together that the goals overlap.

*Do parts of the game distract players so they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?*
- The goal of the player is to destroy enemies and the gameplay never looses sight of that. The camera is static and the levels are conceptualized to only fulfil that goal. There are no distractions.

*Does my game provide a steady stream of gradually increasing challenges?*
- This is not defined in the GDD. The concept lacks the explanation of challenge both in math but also in mechanics.

*Are the player's skills improving as expected? If not, how can I change that?*
- This has to be tested, but the player has a very easy introduction and the learning curve could be very steep in the beginning.

#### Lens of Skill

*What skills does my game require from the player?*
- The skill level required from the player regarding the interaction and mechanics is fairly simple and easy to pick up as the player only has to adjust variables in the formula which he can do by clicking on buttons. Mathematical wise, the player has to have a very basic understanding of linear functions, he should have at least seen a linear equation formula once. But also without a lot of knowledge the player is able to play this game.

*Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?*
- The game covers the very basics and has potential to scale up and also cover more of the learning goals and by extension more categories of skill. But this is not described in the GDD and therefore cannot be judged.

*Which skills are dominant?*
- The skill of understanding how the variables in the linear equations work together. Other to that the player does not need any knowledge or skills, it certainly helps if he already has an advanced understanding but it is not needed.

*Are these skills creating the experience I want?*
- Due to the game not needing any great skills, the experience that the designers intended is very likely to occur.

*Are some players much better at these skills than others?*
- Some players will inevitably be better at this game and pick up the math and mechanics faster, but this is to be expected as not all students are on the same level of understanding.

*Does this make the game feel unfair?*
- No, this game is not reliant on skill or mathematical knowledge which makes it fair and easy also for first time players.

*Can players improve their skills with practice?*
- Yes, if the players invest more time into perfecting their skills and knowledge it will become easier and the player will improve.

*Does this game demand the right level of skill?*
- This game does not demand a specific level of skill which makes it easy for every type of player to pick up and succeed. Mathematical wise the game is easier to play if the player has a basic understanding of linear equations and graphs.

#### Concept Dependent Lenses

*Define which Game Lenses you are going to use. Choose 1 to 5 matching ones and answer all the questions clear and concise*

*Are we able to answer them? Does it give a clear view about the game and gameplay?*

- [69] The Lens of Interest Curve

  - If I draw an interest curve of my experience, how is it shaped?
    - Start: The player is interested in how exactly the game works and the interest is high.
    - Midpoint: The player gets used to the functionality of the game and the interest drops. It might spike every time he starts a new level as he wants to know how it looks and how to solve it.
    - End: The interest will plummet because the game has no described end and no hook to keep the player engaged aside from clearing every level.

  - Doest it have a hook?
    - No, this game does not have a hook. It is a very casual game and there is no hook described in the GDD. The players will only keep on playing because they want to progress and see which levels will come after. But there is no defined end and the game could be made more interesting by adding different mechanics and a progression through-line which aims at a greater end. They could work through different biomes etc.

  - Is there gradually rising interest, punctuated by periods of rest?
    - No. This game peaks in the beginning and will become very repetitive over time especially because it does not aim at something greater and has no hook and no end.

  - Is there a grand finale, more interesting than everything else?
    - No, in the GDD there is no end described.

  - What changes would give me a better interest curve?
    - New mechanics, new or different types enemies, maybe different worlds that the player can discover, each with their own special set of enemies with different abilities.

  - Is there a fractural structure to my interest curve?
    - No, the curve peaks in the beginning and then steadily goes down until the player is bored, and there is nothing in place to prevent that from happening.

  - Do my intuitions about the interest curve match the observed interest of the players? If I ask play testers to draw an interest cure, what does it look like?
    - *We cannot answer this question as of now*

- [38] The Lens of Challenge

  - What are the challenges in my game?
    - The challenges are to defeat the enemy by launching different missiles and bombs at him with a cannon. The mechanics and input system is very easy to pick up the the math is fairly simple as well as the player only has to adjust the different variables in the formula.

  - Are they too easy, too hard, or just right?
    - For players experienced and with a deep understanding of math it might be too easy, but for first time players who just had their first introductory lesson about linear equations this game is perfect. It offers a interesting gameplay experience for a broad audience but it cannot cover all of them.

  - Can my challenges accommodate a wide variety of skill levels?
    - For students who are new to linear equations the challenge is matching and because there is no progression described, we cannot make an assumption or judgement on how this challenge will evolve and cover more skills or extended skill sets of more experienced players.

  - How does the level of challenge increase as the player succeeds?
    - This is not described in the GDD.

  - Is there enough variety in my challenges?
    - There is only one demo level and no progression described, so they cannot be used to form judgement of the variety of challenge in the game.

  - What is the maximum level of challenges in my game?
    - This is not described in the GDD.

### Dynamics & Aesthetics

*Are the proposed aesthetics achieved with the current mechanics? Do the dynamics support the aesthetics? Do you agree with the proposed explanation in the GDD?* 

**Challenge**: Game as obstacle course
- Challenge is found in the levels as the player has to find out how the linear equations work and which one works best to defeat the enemy and bring the structure to collapse. There is no further challenged as the GDD has not described the progression of the gameplay and math aspect, and we cannot make judgement.

**Discovery**: Game as uncharted territory
- The game offers each level new enemies and structures to defeat and destroy. The player can also level up with the skill tree which can be looked at as discovering new abilities. In the GDD discovery is also described as the player discovering new functions and equations that help him defeat the enemy and progress through the levels. Other to that there is no discovery described. The game-loop is repetitive especially because there is no progression described.

## Concept 2: Myth Digger

### Core Ideas and Values

#### Serious Games

**Definition**: A game intending on teaching the player a concept or skill applicable in the real world.

The game fulfils the set definition. It teaches the player math concepts and linear functions.

It does so in the following forms:

- Building the railroad, using linear equations to plan the layout of the rails.
- Processing, filling in the right x or y values into the table to fulfil the process.
- Crafting, calculate x and y intercepts to determine where the hammer needs to hit.
  The challenges and exercises are creatively implemented and cover a large basis of knowledge.

Although it works more as a testing environment and less as a "teaching" experience.
It feels a little bit like an improved version of function dungeon I.
Instead of just testing, the tests have been incorporated more into the story, i.e. the above mentioned incorporations of linear equations.

#### Content

##### Learning Content

The learning content is incorporated properly, as can be seen in the following:

1. Playing with the fundamental characteristics of a linear function first individually and then in combination.

> Fulfilled, they place the railroad tracks by adjusting the *a* and *b* values of the linear equation.

2. Applying the fundamental characteristics to transform one representation (verbal, graph, formula, table) into another in a playful way.

> Fulfilled, they process the materials by solving a function with the help of a table.

3. Solving quests, tasks and problems involving multiple representations of linear function (verbal, graph, formula, table).

> Fulfilled, multiple representations can be found in the following:
>
> - Building the railroad, using linear equations to plan the layout of the rails.
> - Processing, filling in the right x or y values into the table to fulfil the process.
> - Crafting, calculate x and y intercepts to determine where the hammer needs to hit.

4. Applying properties of linear functions to solve equations in a playful way.

> Fulfilled, the game offers a variety of different ways to solve linear functions, ranging from easy to complex tasks that increase in difficulty the further you progress in the game.

5. Applying the appropriate function representation to solve a question or problem in the game.

> Fulfilled, the features in the game have incorporated different ways to incorporate linear functions. Each of these have been made suitable for the situation, i.e. calculate the intercepts of two lines to hit the right spot during crafting.

##### Game Content

#### Scalability

**Definitions**:

- Ability to include and expand on the learning goals.

  - The game has included all five learning goals, i.e. placing railroad tracks, processing and crafting.
  - The game cannot directly be expanded because all the learning goals given by the client are incorporated. There has been no explanation on how the learning goals could be expanded upon, i.e. processing is only going to be tables.
- Ability to scale the content and duration of the game, allowing the client to expand in the future.

  - The game could be extended in the future for example with a more diverse variety of materials, harder enemy waves in the caves etc.

#### Adaptability

**Definition**: How well is the product able to be used in different situations, e.g. it can be used in the curriculum in multiple ways.

Myth digger is a game most suited for playing in your free time or in a designated lesson in which you only play this game. In case that it has been used for a lesson it cannot be done often due to the nature of the game. The game is not level based and to complete the whole game it takes a long time.

#### Difficulty

##### Game Difficulty

**Definition**: The level of challenge the game content presents.

Yes, the game offers an easy introduction and will get more difficult the longer you play, which keeps the gameplay experience interesting.

##### Mathematics Difficulty

**Definition**: The level of challenge the learning content presents.

*Only and only if* the game has to start with the player placing the railroads.

From easy to hard:

- Altering the function: By visualizing this process in the placement of the railroad track it's easy to see how this works/is implemented.
- Processing: Calculating and filling in the table.
- Crafting: Calculating the x/y intercept in order to define the hammer placement.

After this the process will look like: Place railroads -> Mining -> Processing -> Crafting -> Place railroads

#### Accessibility

**Definition**: The player can play the game regardless of their mathematical skills, game skills and hardware.

- Mathematical skills: this game can pose quite a challenge for someone who is not/slightly familiar with linear equations. See: Difficulty -> Mathematics difficulty.
- Gameplay skills: as long as the introduction of the controls is clearly stated, the game can be played even by inexperienced gamers.
- Hardware: the game is intended to be played on web, so the hardware is not a big focus. As long as they have a browser, they are able to play the game.

#### Core Values

##### Client Design Values

- Gameplay is entertainment first, education second

  - The idea is very story/design/art heavy, however due to the implementation of the math stuff it kind off feels like a testing environment (Like function dungeon I >:D ).
- Complexity around linear functions is scalable

  - Complexity is scalable because the functions are implemented directly which gives a lot of options to increase the challenge.
- Gameplay needs to be validated through play tests by external players

  - Yes
- Target audience, aged 12 to 16, level VWO

  - This game is more suitable for those aged above 13 and like to play games (gamers).
- Gameplay is adaptable so it can be used inside and outside of the classroom

  - Myth Digger is better used outside of the classroom. The game is not suited for a casual play when there are 10min left in the class, but more for a planned lesson of only playing this game.
- Game needs to be designed for web

  - Layout wise the game has been designed for web, i.e. all sketches etc. have been based on it.
- Authorability should be a key element

  - x

##### Team Design Values

- Linear algebra has to be incorporated in the design of the core gameplay loop

  - In myth digger it can be found in mechanics, i.e. placing tracks, processing, crafting.
- Fun has to be considered over education in design

  - The concept is very story heavy, which is good for a finished game, but our prototype will be very education heavy.
- The game develops an understanding of the algebra it attempts to teach

  - The game does not really teaches the player the algebra, but is perfect for students who already have a bit of knowledge and want to strengthen their knowledge.
- Accessible and designed to be easy to pick up

  - The game requires a bit more knowledge on how to play it and how everything works, but it is easy to pick up. So this won't present itself as a problem.
- Concept is scalable in complexity

  - Due to the infinite nature of the game, i.e. discovering new caves, the game has great possibilities for future ideas (be it in difficulty or content).
- Game needs to be designed for web

  - Yes

### Game Lenses

- [7] The Lens of Endogenous Value

  - What is valuable to the players in my game?

    - The collected resources that help the player to go deeper and explore more of the caves and then eventually slay the dragon.
    - Exploring new and fresh areas which bring new collectables, enemies and environments.
    - Progressing in the game, slaying the dragon and completing the game.
  - How can I make it more valuable to them?

    - Add a variety in general, and specifically in resources, collectables, enemies and environments.
    - Progress wise, you could add a progressbar which shows how far down in the cave you are and how much further you have to go to reach the dragon.
  - What is the relationship between value in the game and the players' motivations?

    - They want to progress and slay the dragon, there has to be enough content and challenge for gamers to keep coming back.
    - Discoveries have to add something to the game, they have to give the player a fresh feeling (like *[WOOOOW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxtD2p_87as)*).
- [21]  The Lens of Flow

  - Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?

    - The general goals have been described pretty well such as mine resources, process resources and crafting. However it is unclear as to how the player knows what to do in the game.

  - Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?

    - The goals of us are to teach them math in a fun way. The goal of the player is to learn math but also to progress in the game and there is no clear explanation for him on how to do it.

  - Do parts of the game distract players so they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?

    - No, there are no side quests or anything that could distract them of the goal.
    - The math can be distracting, because the player wants to slay the dragon and the solving of the equations and math feels more like an obstacle to them. Aside from the placement of the tracks, it almost feels like a better version of Function Dungeon. This is due to the fact that in order to integrate the equations in a more subtle manner, the game is quite heavily dependent on stuff like art-style, sound, music, particles etc.
  - Does my game provide a steady stream of gradually increasing challenges?

    - Yes, the game gives different exercises with various degrees of challenge.
      - For crafting and processing the difficulty is mostly centered around the linear equations.
      - Enemies can get progressively more difficult to fight over time (per cave).

  - Are the player's skills improving as expected? If not, how can I change that?

    - *We don't know, needs to be tested*
    - Assumption: The players skill (math and gameplay related) are improving over the course the game, simply due to repeating the gameplay loop over and over again.

> Our goal: To teach math topics in a fun game.

> Player goal: Reach the dragon to kill it.

- [55] Lens of Visible Progress

  - What does it mean to make progress in my game?

    - Decent deeper into the cave, get more resources, defeat enemies and slay the dragon.
  - Is there enough progress in my game? Is there a way I can add more interim steps of progressive success?

    - Yes, the general gist of progress is there.
    - Yes, there are possible additions which can be made to the game these are not required as of now.
  - What progress is visible, and what progress is hidden? Can I find a way to reveal what is hidden?

    - The progress of the excavation of the cave is visible but the progress on the way to slay the dragon is hidden. There is no way, as of currently, to know how far along are you on your way down to the dragon's lair.
- [69] The Lens of Interest Curve

  - If I draw an interest curve of my experience, how is it shaped?

    - Start game: high interest, because they want to get going and discover the whole game
    - Mid game: interest dips, because gameplay gets repetitive with mining, coming back up, process and crafting all the things and go back down to do it all again. If they encounter enemies the interest shoots back up.
      - Discover cave: high interest (my new shiny cave)
      - Mining: in the beginning it's high, and when it gets repetitive the player is less motivated
      - Processing and crafting: in the beginning it's mid, and when it gets repetitive the player is less motivated
    - End game: interest at a low, game is repetitive, if they do reach a boss (the dragon) interest is back up.
  - Doest it have a hook?

    - Yes, at the end you get to slay a dragon, minecraft style.
  - Is there gradually rising interest, punctuated by periods of rest?

    - It's not gradually rising, it is levelling until you encounter the dragon and then the interest is back up.
  - Is there a grand finale, more interesting than everything else?

    - Yes, there is the dragon at the end of the game.
  - What changes would give me a better interest curve?

    - The integration of not only different tunnels but also different types of bioms within these tunnels. So that the player can always look forward to discover a deeper layer with new resources and enemy types.

  - Is there a fractural structure to my interest curve?

    - Not particularly. This fact ties back to the repetitiveness of the gameplay. It could solved by implementing different bioms or enemies (which you have granted, the enemies that is) etc.

    > See the first question of: The Lens of Interest Curve.
  - Do my intuitions about the interest curve match the observed interest of the players? If I ask playtesters to draw an interest cure, what does it look like?

    - *We cannot answer this question as of now*

### Dynamics & Aesthetics

- **Fantasy**: Game as make believe

The fantasy aspect is incorporated within all mechanics. Especially with mining for ressources, exploring the caves and encountering enemies that you need to defeat.
The idea on how to incorporate processing and crafting does give a fantasy like feel, but due to the mathematics this feeling does not fully support *fantasy*.

- **Challenge**: Game as obstacle course

The mining part is simple and relatively easy to understand, the harder part is the placing of the tracks. Here the challenge of the math comes in and the understanding of how to best place the tracks. The player can explore the caves and encounters enemies which also play into the challenge. The processing and crafting are both math based and are dependant on how hard the math questions are or how good the player is at math.

All-in-all the game allows for some easy gameplay and some difficult gameplay which supports the aesthetic: *Challenge*.

- **Discovery**: Game as uncharted territory

The need to find and navigate ore tunnels gives the player a sense of exploration (discovery). Further supported by the idea that multiple resources have to be scavenged from the cave(s). This is all a result from the combination of the mechanics and dynamics. The progression is such that the player is always focused on exploring and/or discovering something new.

In short the game is mostly centered around and focused on the aesthetic of *Discovery*.

## Concept 3: Mushroom of Bloom

### Core Ideas and Values

#### Serious Games

The concept of Mushroom of BLOOM does fall under a serious game; it intends to teach mathematical skills as taught in a classroom. It has integrated linear functions within its core mechanics, by seeing visual representations of those graphs and adjusting them in-game. Although ideas like putting the UI increments on the turret's barrel directly discourage the player from looking at the equation itself and might result in a disconnect between the math and game.

#### Content

##### Learning Content

1. Playing with the fundamental characteristics of a linear function ~~first individually and then~~ in combination.
   - Partially fulfilled, they make sure the tower's trajectory are determined by the player adjusting the *a* and *b* value of the linear equations, however both are introduced at once
2. Applying the fundamental characteristics to transform one representation (verbal, graph, formula, table) into another in a playful way.
   - Fulfilled, they give the player the option to pick the linear function from a pool of cards.
3. Solving quests, tasks and problems involving multiple representations of linear function (graph, formula).
   - Fulfilled, the player has the option of having the tower shoot in multiple ways:
     - Defining the coordinates, the tower will shoot at the point was picked out by the player
     - Choosing the matching function card, the tower will shoot using the picked function as a trajectory
     - Altering a function, the player can adjust the graph lines to determine where the shot will land
     - Writing a new function, using graph lines to create a function to shoot
4. ~~Applying properties of linear functions to solve equations in a playful way.~~
   - Listed as not implemented, however we disagree; the card mechanic is an especially good example of applying properties to solve the function.
5. Applying the appropriate function representation to solve a question or problem in the game.
   - Fulfilled to an extent, there is an optimal card to choose for example, but it feels frail because you can place the tower wherever you'd like

##### Game Content

The gameplay feels entirely detached from the narrative. Try to think about more in universe concepts and events that can lead to interesting mechanics that sets the game apart from other tower defence games. In terms of UI clarity, Idea 1 and 2 from the 'Adjust Function (Intermediate)' are flawed. The learning goals require the player to interact and think about the linear functions. By placing the increment buttons on the tower's barrel instead of on the function, you are inviting the player to potentially not engage with the math and just take the trajectory at face value. The same thing is true for dragging the handler. Instead of having the player drag the handler, you can invite them to change the *x* value so the magnitued of the line is still altered but with the direct involvement of the player.

The dynamic music is a good idea, getting the player into the right mindset for the different states of the game. The sound design also alligns with the silly narrative and idle nature of tower defence games. Thinking about the theme in terms of audio with the wind and bees for example are also strong foundations for making the game immersive.

#### Scalability

- **Definition:** Ability to include and expand on the learning goals.

  - While not listed in the document, there is a way to expand on the learning goals by introducing levels that already have predetermined tower positions. All you can do is 'activate' them with flowers. Then you have the option of determining their shooting trajectory. On top of that, you can restrict the ability to change either the *a* or *b* value to gradually introduce the player to both.
   
- **Definition:** Ability to scale the content and duration of the game, allowing the client to expand in the future.
  
  - The game can easily be expanded upon by introducing new types of towers, enemy types and weaknesses and level designs.

#### Adaptability

**Definition:** How well is the product able to be used in different situations, e.g. it can be used in the curriculum in multiple ways.

While possible to use in a classroom setting directly, the game lends itself best as a supplemental to the curriculum, perhaps as a classroom challenge to maintain a highest possible score on the daily challenges or the furthest progress. If authorability is integrated in the final product, the teachers could design their own levels as math challenges within the classroom itself; but as the concept is currently described, Mushroom of BLOOM appears most appropriate as a side activity.

#### Difficulty

##### Game Difficulty

**Definition:*** The level of challenge the game content presents.

- Yes, the game will get more difficult the longer you play. The enemies will become stronger and more plentiful as well as the level designs getting more complex.

##### Mathematics Difficulty

**Definition:** The level of challenge the learning content presents.

The math-based challenges increase in difficulty by unlocking different methods of applying the function, putting the player in a more complex situation in which the function is used. Different kinds of function applications such as tables or only a line are not used however.

#### Accessibility

**Definition:** The player can play the game regardless of their mathematical skills, game skills and hardware.

- In terms of math skills, this game is accessible. It does require some knowledge of linear functions to be picked up, but not to a degree it becomes completely unusable if the player has little skills in the subject. The knowledge scales, and allows for more difficult applications of the mechanics, making it considerably less boring for those that are more knowledgable.
- For game skillls and ability, the game is easy to pick up. The mechanics are not so complicated that those with little game experience will struggle heavily; the turn-based nature allows for them to take their time and pick up the mechanics at their own pace. For more experienced players, they are not hindered, instead being able to use their knowledge of strategy and mechanics as a whole to push through it at a faster pace.
- Hardware accessibility might be a bottleneck. High end graphics are described in the GDD which does not lend itself well to a web-based game. Some of the size and scope in things like weekly or daily challenges might not be so suitable, but can be adjusted or removed based on this requirement if necessary.

#### Core Values

##### Client Design Values

- Gameplay is entertainment first, education second
  - Fulfilled; the game is not preachy about the mathematics it tries to teach. They are part of the main game loop and thus on the forefront, but they are brought forward in a fun and engaging way.
- Complexity around linear functions is scalable
  - Fulfilled, as the path and enemy AI can be scaled in difficulty to require more complex linear equations.
- Gameplay needs to be validated through play tests by external players
  - This will be fullfilled further in development.
- Target audience, aged 12 to 16, level VWO
  - Fulfilled; gameplay is accessible and engaging for a wider range of ages and game experience.
- Gameplay is adaptable so it can be used inside and outside of the classroom
  - The game is most suitable as a supplemental to the class rather than be used as an active learning tool - however, it could be used if authorability for the teacher is actively involved. If the teacher can determine levels and the progression, this game could be used in the class itself.
- Game needs to be designed for web
  - The input as well as the general complexity of the gameplay seems to fulfill this, however the description of high end graphics as well as the possibility of customization unlocks and daily or weekly challenges lean more towards a more dedicated web hosting where players can make accounts or a separate dedicated (mobile) app. This is not a bad thing on its own, but should be taken into account.
- Authorability should be a key element
  - Levels could technically be designed by teachers as the simple straightfoward nature of the mechanics makes it easy to understand and build from, however, this is not directly addressed in the GDD.

##### Team Design Values

- Linear algebra has to be incorporated in the design of the core gameplay loop
  - Fulfilled; tower building and how they are aimed directly incorporate linear algebra and accurate representations of functions.
- Fun has to be considered over education in design
  - Fulfilled; the game uses linear functions, but by making it a direct part of the gameplay loop feels more like a game than an educational test.
- The game develops an understanding of the algebra it attempts to teach
  - Some implementations of interactions with the functions appear detached from each other; rather than manipulating the function and seeing the result, the player adjusts the line and sees the function, which does not stimulate active thinking about what the function could do. Depending on the implementation chosen, this could be fulfilled, or be lacking in some regard.
- Accessible and designed to be easy to pick up
  - The gameplay is simple, straightforward, and easy to understand. There is no fluff of preamble. It does require some knowledge of linear functions in order to play effectively, but not to a degree it can't be learned.
- Concept is scalable in complexity
  - Fulfilled, as the amount of towers, the complexity of those towers as well as the enemies and the maps can be increased as time progresses, leaving room for various designs.
- Game needs to be designed for web
  - As mentioned before, this is true to a degree after which it becomes slightly more complex requiring a more dedicated website or (mobile) app. However, these elements can be stripped or simplified in order to fit this requirement if the client needs it to be so.

### Game Lenses

- **[2] The Lens of Essential Experience**

  - *What experience do I want the player to have?*
    - The player should intrinsically want to play and return to the game. This is so the player can properly familiarize themselves with the linear functions.
  - *What is essential to the experience?*
    - A system that invites player retention and return value.
  - *How can my game capture that essence?*
    - Daily challenges is the easy solution. But making an Idle side mini-game could also invite the player to come back regularly to see how their game fares.
- **[34] The Lens of Skill**

  - *What skills does my game require from the player?*
    - First and foremost it requires skill and knowledge in linear functions, as well as a degree of strategic thinking for the tower placement and upgrades.
  - *Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?*
    - No categories are missing given the game's genre and context.
  - *Which skills are dominant?*
    - Stategy, and math skills.
  - *Are these skills creating the experience I want?*
    - These skills force the player to think about and consider linear functions as well as their placement with in the context of the world, which is part of the design goals lined out prior to creating this concept.
  - *Are some players much better at these skills than others?*
    - Yes - some students will grasp math quicker and easier than others, and thus have a higher skill at a quicker pace.
  - *Does this make the game feel unfair?*
    - No, because the game paces the difficulty carefully to not make the player feel like they are stuck in something above their skill level right off the bat.
  - *Can players improve their skills with practice?*
    - Yes, thanks to the gradual increase of difficulty and the possibility to replay levels at any moment. This allows the player to grow with the game.
  - *Does this game demand the right level of skill?*
    - The game has taken the target group into consideration, as well as the questions they would be asked in a math class for that level and scaled the game accordingly. Additionally, the tower defense elements of the game are appropriate for multiple skill levels, without demanding more than the player might be able to handle.
- **[39] The Lens Of Meaningful Choices**

  - *What choices am I asking the players to make?*
    - Tower placement and upgrades, to defeat the enemies that swarm the player.
  - *Are they meaningful? How?*
    - The player has to make well-thought out decisions in order to keep themselves alive and the game progress further.
  - *Am I giving the player the right number of choices? Would more make them feel more powerful? Would fewer make the game clearer?*
    - This is heavily reliant on game design, and if the towers are limited - if so, the amount of towers has to be refined in order to give the player the right amount of power without feeling overly powerful. Otherwise, purchasing an infinite amount of towers may result in too many choices, being overly powerful or like the input of the world itself will not matter.
  - *Are there dominant strategies in my game?*
    - As this game is in the prototyping phase, this question cannot be answered as of yet.
- **[93.5] The Lens of Presence**

  - *Is my player experience a sense of presence? Could it be stronger?*
    - The player is a royal strategist defending the kingdom. Their presence is the one commanding everything to happen. But the player could have a stronger sense of presence.
  - *What in my game is diminishing or breaking presence?*
    - There is no physical representation for the player within the level. They're an almighty entity dictating where and what towers will be placed.
  - *What in my game is building or strengthening presence?*
    - The instant feedback the player gets when placing a tower gives them a sense of agency. Which is essential for the player to feel their presence in the game.

### Dynamics & Aesthetics

- Sensation: the game as sense pleasure
  Especially in polish, this game does reach a level of sense-pleasure; the screen shakes, the particles fly out on a successful hit, the sound reflects all input and makes the overal experience *feel* satisfying to perform. Thus, this game achieves the aesthetic of sensation.
- Challenge: the game as obstacle course
  The game provides several levels and challenges within, placing towers strategically and making them fire in the correct directions. Incorrect decisions or strategic blunders provide a danger and are an obstacle to overcome, honing their skill and adapting to the situation at hand, giving them a challenge.
- Expression: the game as self-discovery
  The player can experiment and figure out their preferred strategy to complete the levels. You can play to turtle or you can play aggresive. Playing for economy or playing to permanently better your units. Invest in many smaller units or getting a few big ones. All these allow the player to express themselves and their preferences within the game, allowing for the aesthetic of expression.
- Submission the game as pastime
  The game doesn't require many inputs from the player. Once the turrets are set up, it's basically just a waiting game. This can be desirable for people that want to do other tasks while still having something to be engaged by. However, those with little knowledge of tower defense games or who lack in math skill might find this game more difficult and not as much of a relaxing or engaging pastime, leaving this aesthetic somewhat questionable.

## Concept 4: Kaiju Killer

### Core Ideas and Values

#### Serious Games

**Definition**: A game intending on teaching the player a concept or skill applicable in the real world.

The game attempts to teach linear equations by creating a learning environment for the student where he can practice already learned techniques. The game works best if th following requirement has been met: the teacher has already taught the student basic math and they are expected to have a basic level of understanding 

The math introduced in this game is applicable in the real world. Linear functions can be found in various implementations in real life, most obviously during tests at school. The game creates an environment which introduces a different experience from the typical classroom. This allows the player to see the math content from a new angle and experience something fresh.

The game serves primarily as an application to reinforce the player's mathematical skills by practising their previously established knowledge.

#### Content

##### Learning Content

The learning content has been incorporated properly, as can be seen in the following:

1. Playing with the fundamental characteristics of a linear function first individually and then in combination.

> Not fulfilled, in the game the player is supposed to fill in entire equation, or the final answer. There is no manipulating *parts* of a function.
> *Partially* fulfilled, the player does not interact with the linear function by pressing a button but by entering the function by hand.

2. Applying the fundamental characteristics to transform one representation (verbal, graph, formula, table) into another in a playful way.

> Fulfilled, the player can interact with multiple different ways of representations. For example the player has to adjust/fill-in the entire equation, fill-out a table and calculate intercepts. In the end these will be translated into the *ROBB-E PUNCH*!

3. Solving quests, tasks and problems involving multiple representations of linear function (verbal, graph, formula, table).

> Fulfilled, multiple representations can be found in the following:
>
> - Adjusting the linear equation to throw a punch at a kaiju.
> - Calculating intercepts to calculate the weak points of the kaiju.
> - Writing/completing in a table to define the trajectory of the punch.

4. Applying properties of linear functions to solve equations in a playful way.

> Fulfilled, the game offers multiple ways of solving the equations all packaged in this setting of killing kaiju as a mech (ROBB-E). I.e.: Filling in the linear equation, calculating intercepts, completing the values in a table.

5. Applying the appropriate function representation to solve a question or problem in the game.

> Fulfilled, the game offers various features and implementations of different function representations to solve the level at hand. They are usually translated by the player from a equation or a table into a punch.

##### Game Content

*How does the game include narrative, art, sound and further game and or level design?*

In order for the game to work properly it has to be implemented with at least full art! The core gameplay loop is very basic; interacting and writing functions. The experience is based very heavily on the polish, such as the story, art, SFX etc.. The narrative is cohesive and understandable; simple enough to be engaging without being overwhelming and taking away from the central plot point of learning linear equations. The levels and waves vary by having different types of enemies attack the player which also ties in the story. The levels, however, do have the potential to be extremely repetitive because the setting does not change. This could be countered by having different stages, different backgrounds and a big selection of how enemies look, behave, feel and act.

#### Scalability

*Ability to include and expand on the learning goals.*
- The concept covers the learning goals 2-5 fully. On top of that the game allows for expansion by introducing new equations or alter the way they're used in the game.<!--and the first learning goal partially. -->
- Due to its simplicity the game is suited for expansion upon the established learning goals in different manners. For example the visual support, i.e. showing the trajectory of the punch, could be adjusted to more see through or non-visible.

*Ability to scale the content and duration of the game, allowing the client to expand in the future.*
- Story wise the game is very clear cut, but it allows future expansion to the gameplay by adding more stages, kaijus, waves etc..
- Content can easily be adjusted and added to the game by teachers or designers. This ensures that the concept can be expanded upon, therefore ensuring scalability as well. Kaiju Killer also allows future integration of quadratic functions, even though the current game is focused on linear equations (, tables and graphs).

#### Adaptability

**Definition**: How well is the product able to be used in different situations, e.g. it can be used in the curriculum in multiple ways.

The current game play is most suited as a test environment, this makes the game very adaptable. It can be used at school as supplementary content for the classroom. It is most suited as an activity for students who have already finished their work and have to fill the last 10 min. of class. The fully developed version of the game can be adjusted by the teacher to lay the focus on specific questions, or interactions like tables, and can be played outside of the classroom to test and/or strengthen the knowledge of the students.

#### Difficulty

##### Game Difficulty

**Definition**: The level of challenge the game content presents.

The game starts off with an easy way to interact with equations and introduces new ways of interacting the function. As the game progresses the interactions get progressively more difficult, but also give the player enough time to get familiar with the concept. The gameplay itself does not change much throughout the game which also makes it easy for inexperienced players to engage with the content. The game also offers two kinds of modifications for the player; first off parts which give ROBB-E extra or increased specs. and secondly purely aesthetical parts, these don't serve as upgrades but more as a form of self expression and are therefore not needed to complete the game. 

##### Mathematics Difficulty

**Definition**: The level of challenge the learning content presents.

The learning content in this game is very scalable. The difficulty of the mathematics can increased by making the math questions harder, or by altering visual elements such as the trajectory of the punch. For example the trajectory of the punch could be removed which would increase the complexity of the interaction. Throughout the game the player gets introduced to various ways to interact with linear equations and has enough time to get used to each of them. Which makes sure that the mathematical difficulty serves as a manageable, but challenging engagement.

#### Accessibility

*Is the game accessible as defined by the team? Why? How?*

**Definition**: The player can play the game regardless of their mathematical skills, game skills and hardware.

- Mathematical skills: this game serves as a very good testing environment to reinforce the students knowledge, and understanding of linear equations. It does not introduce the player to new mathematical concepts in a understandable and cohesive way.
- Gameplay skills: the concept is very simplistic and presents itself with few types of input and interaction systems. This in turn makes it easier for new players to pick up by setting the entry bar low for inexperienced gamers.
- Hardware: the game is intended to be played on web, so the hardware is not a big focus. As long as the player has a browser, they are able to play the game.

#### Core Values

##### Client Design Values

- Gameplay is entertainment first, education second
  - The game relies heavily on the use of visuals (including polish) to convey the story. Without these the gameplay experience suffers greatly. The game itself is centred on defeating waves of kaiju which places entertainment first and education second. The game introduces new ways to interact with the linear function gradually throughout the gameplay which makes it easy for the player to get used to the functions slowly and in a playful way.

- Complexity around linear functions is scalable
  - The complexity around the linear functions in this game is scalable. The designer can add or remove elements from the game like the visual trajectory (, which makes it easier for the player to see where he is going to hit,) so the gameplay becomes more challenging. This can be done for all of the ways the linear functions are interacted with in this game. The game also allows for more complex functions to be implemented which makes this game suitable to scalability.

- Gameplay needs to be validated through play tests by external players
  - Testing is planned for this concept.

- Target audience, aged 12 to 16, level VWO
  - Yes

- Gameplay is adaptable so it can be used inside and outside of the classroom
  - The gameplay is adaptable. It can be used within the class and the classroom for students who are bored or already finished with the work for this specific class as a 5 to 10min activity. It can also be used outside of the classroom in the players free time or as a extracurricular activity. The teacher also has the ability to create new and specific waves and elements that focus on one particular interaction with the function, which makes it easier for them to actually include this concept into the classroom.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  - This is fulfilled. The game is designed with web in mind as it presents a easy gameplay without a lot of rendering heavy elements and an easy input system.

- Authorability should be a key element
  - The game offers the ability for the teachers to create their own waves or levels and adjust already existing levels. This allows for a more seamless integration into classroom activities; it allows to set the focus on one specific function related interaction. 

##### Team Design Values

- Linear algebra has to be incorporated in the design of the core gameplay loop
  - The core gameplay loop is to type/interact with functions. This game fulfils this criteria by adjusting or writing linear equations the player fights with the enemies. Without this interaction the gameplay is close to non-existent.

- Fun has to be considered over education in design
  - The fun in this game relies heavily on how it looks and on the story. The concept in it's core (typing functions) is not fun or engaging in itself. But packaged as the kaiju killer it promises an engaging and fun experience.

- The game develops an understanding of the algebra it attempts to teach
  - The game sets out to consolidate knowledge that is already in existence and does not teach new concepts to the player. This game is best used in the context of the player already having a basic understanding of one type of interaction, for example writing the function on their own, and then practising this over and over again. 

- Accessible and designed to be easy to pick up
  - The game is very easy to pick up. The gameplay is not in any way complicated and only relies on the input / interaction with the function and not on any other fancy way of gameplay.

- Concept is scalable in complexity
  - The concept is very scalable as it allows for the teachers to create their own content. The concept is scalable in length but also in complexity of all the math aspects i.e. having different ways to interact with the function, having the option to ask harder questions and to make the questions harder not by increasing the difficulty of the math but by removing guidance like a visible trajectory.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  - The game is designed for web. It has a very simple input system and does not rely on hardware heavy graphics or interactions. 

### Game Lenses

#### Lens of Flow

- *Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?*
    - The game has a clear goal of defeating the Kaiju, and saving the world by solving equations.

- *Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?*
    - Yes, the player has the goal of defeating the Kaiju and saving the world.
    - No, the player is not really guided on how to learn and/or apply the math they kinda get tested to do it.

- *Do parts of the game distract players so they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?*
    - There are no distractions as the game is very simplistic. Fill in the right equation/answer and the Kaiju will be hit.

- *Does my game provide a steady stream of gradually increasing challenges?*
  - Yes, the game steadily increases the difficulty of the questions and puzzles by removing helping visuals, more difficult math questions and by introducing new ways to interact with the math aspect i.e. tables.

- *Are the player's skills improving as expected? If not, how can I change that?*
  - This game works best in the setting of letting the student practice with the content provided. It should not serve as the only source of teaching. They cannot improve upon techniques they have not learned yet but can improve and/or reinforce their skill on already introduced math concepts. Gameplay wise the mechanics are simple and easy to understand; so the player does not need to improve their skills, but can focus on the math aspect.

#### Lens of Skill

- *What skills does my game require from the player?*
  - The game has a very simple input system so it does not require the player to be familiar with gaming and the usual w,a,s,d or arrow keys for movement. Math wise they need to have a basic understanding of how linear functions work and know how to use the different ways a function can be represented i.e how a table works etc.

- *Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?*
  - The game does not cover verbal interaction with the mathematical aspect which is stated in the learning goals. But as this is very hard to achieve it can be left out without great impact. The game could be considered of missing the explanatory element, the player already has to have a basic understanding of math and the concepts the game tries to solidify.

- *Which skills are dominant?*
  - This game is designed with the mathematical aspect really being in the centre of the interaction which also makes them more dominant. For a game that attempts to teach linear equations this is perfect. 

- *Are these skills creating the experience I want?*
  - The experience we want the player to have is that he has enough time to learn and practice his mathematical skills related to linear functions and equations. This game gives the player the space to do so.

- *Are some players much better at these skills than others?*
  - Some students will inevitably be better at math than others; by having enough time to think about how they are going to solve the equation this problem is lessened as they don't have the preassure to perform.

- *Does this make the game feel unfair?*
  - No. The game also allows for the mech to be upgraded, which is not a necessity but can help the player and make for a more balanced gameplay experience. 

- *Can players improve their skills with practice?*
  - Yes, this game is aimed to give the player the space to practice their mathematical skills.

- *Does this game demand the right level of skill?*
  - It demands a stable basis of skill regarding the mathematical aspect. Other to that, the game has a easy to understand input system which makes it inviting for non-gamers to use as well.

#### Concept Dependent Lenses

*Define which Game Lenses you are going to use. Choose 1 to 5 matching ones and answer all the questions clear and concise*

- [69] The Lens of Interest Curve

  - If I draw an interest curve of my experience, how is it shaped?
    - Start: very high, as the player does not know what to expect.
    - Midpoint: By introducing new enemies and new ways of interacting with the function the player can peak his interest. But it will inevitably fall again when the normal kaiju come and the game becomes repetitive.
    - End: high, as the player has to face off and defeat the final world-shattering kaiju.

  - Doest it have a hook?
    - The game does not have a specific hook. It counts on the player wanting to improve and defeat more kaiju. There is no promise made in the game that the player will have to defeat an end-boss and where he stands on the progression. The lack of progression makes it difficult for the player to build excitement/expectations for what is to come.

  - Is there gradually rising interest, punctuated by periods of rest?
    - The game is based on waves with each wave having a boss. This peaks the interest each wave but it will deplete when the new wave starts and they have to fight normal kaiju again. The player can "rest" between each wave and modify their mech with modifications they picked up.

  - Is there a grand finale, more interesting than everything else?
    - Yes. As the finale the player has to face off the world-shattering kaiju and use all his knowledge to defeat him.

  - What changes would give me a better interest curve?
    - Maybe incorporate different world settings that indicate that the player is progressing. On top of that it'd be best to introduce more ways on how to progress in the game, i.e. instead of punching use a laser cannon. Otherwise if the everything stays the same and just the math input methods change the experience will become jarring fairly quick.

  - Is there a fractural structure to my interest curve?
    - Yes. The interest peaks ever so slightly during the wave, i.e. whilst meeting a new (type) of kaiju and when a wave boss has been reached. During the middle part the game gets repetitive making the interest drop until it stagnates and stays continuous. 

  - Do my intuitions about the interest curve match the observed interest of the players? If I ask play testers to draw an interest cure, what does it look like?
    - *We cannot answer this question as of now*


### Dynamics & Aesthetics

*Are the proposed aesthetics achieved with the current mechanics? Do the dynamics support the aesthetics? Do you agree with the proposed explanation in the GDD?*

**Sensation**: Game as sense pleasure

- Once the game would be fully finished the player can experience a lot of visual satisfaction. This would be due to the implementation of the art style, polish. On top of that auditory satisfaction will be able to be found due to background music, SFX etc.

> This is likely to be extremely dependent on the implementation chapter (i.e. polish etc.).

**Fantasy**: Game as make believe

- The game is set in a fantasy setting with robots fighting kaijus in order to save the world. The player is a robot called "robbie" and fights wave after wave on incoming enemies. He has to prepare, gear and level up to be ready for the killer-kaiju which threatens to destroy the world! The fantasy aspect is very good described and presents itself as an immersive and cohesive story.

**Challenge**: Game as obstacle course

- Challenge is supported in the way that a punch is thrown, the player has to solve the equations before they can progress. The player has multiple chances to solve an equation and has no time pressure. The game has a steady progression through the way it introduces new ways to interact with the mathematical aspect i.e linear equations. In addition to that, the game also can be made harder in various different ways for each idea on how to interact with the function.

**Expression**: Game as self-discovery

- The game supports self-discovery by allowing the player to pick what parts should be added to the robot.

## Concept 5: Architect of Goo

### Core Ideas and Values

#### Serious Games

Architect of Goo succeeds well at being a serious game according to our definitions; it has incorporated mathematics into its core gameplay loop, providing a foundation for the mechanics that can't be removed without needing a redesign of the mechanics as a whole. It intends to teach and allow players to practice, but actively forces them to think about what they are doing by requiring them to consider each aspect carefully. 

#### Content

##### Learning Content

1. Playing with the fundamental characteristics of a linear function ~~first~~ individually ~~and then in combination.~~
    - Fulfilled as specified.
2. Applying the fundamental characteristics to transform one representation (graph, formula, table) into another in a playful way.
    - Fulfilled, though in the current GDD not to a high extent - there's a lot of considerations as to different applications of linear functions, but not necessarily different representations.
3. Solving quests, tasks and problems involving multiple representations of linear function (graph, formula).
    - Fullfilled. All the puzzles in order to advance require linear functions, or properties thereof, to be transformed into another object that the player then uses to advance.
4. Applying properties of linear functions to solve equations in a playful way.
    - Fulfilled.
5. Applying the appropriate function representation to solve a question or problem in the game.
    - Fulfilled; the player has to actively select the correct gem - thus the correct 'kind' of solution to the problem they are presented with.

##### Game Content

The game takes its own narrative into account in every aspect and provides a very fun, completed world for the player to mess about in while not being too overwhelming in lore or story. Architect of Goo does, to some degree, need a correct art direction in order to make the narrative visually enjoyable and not become too bland or repetitive. However, the narrative as it is currently posed does allow for a lot of flexibility in this, giving room for interesting worlds or playing around with color schemes and world objects.

Keeping the level designs varied is very important to not make the game too boring; the amount of power the teacher will have in level editing will have to be considered as teachers are not game designers and might end up with a level that is functional, but not fun to play, deterring the students from actively engaging with the work they are given. On the flip side, game designers might focus too much on a level that is fun to play rather than a level that is teaching actively. Finding a middle ground in this should be a priority for later iterations.

#### Scalability

The game does allow for a great deal in scalability; both in gameplay elements in for example the length of the levels and size of the puzzles, but also for mathematic concepts. In designing the mechanics, the ability to apply different kinds of functions was actively considered. However, the gameplay is limited to mathematic concepts that revolve around functions - this seems to be an unavoidable problem, with how tightly the mathematics are interwoven into the mechanics, but this is not a fault of the design itself, simply a sacrifice that needs to be made to achieve the other goals.

#### Adaptability

The game is decently adaptable for both in-classroom use and outside. Giving the teacher authorability on level design gives this game an advantage to be used as an add-on to the curriculum, as the teacher can decide what questions or what kind of interactions the students should practice. The world and the level structure of the game does also invite the player to play it outside of class, as they are fun puzzles and challenges to solve once the base skillset has been taught.

#### Difficulty

##### Game Difficulty

*Does the game difficulty align with what the team defined? How? Why?*

The game offers a lot of different avenues to solve the problems the player faces and allows for a lot of expression of skills and knowledge this way. The mechanics are not so difficult to understand that those without gaming experience will have trouble picking it up and what everything in the game means, and what it does, is easy to grasp. However, the gameplay is more involved, meaning that this game will appeal more to those with more experience in games than those without, and is not likely to be played outside of the classroom unless the student enjoys games as a hobby.

##### Mathematics Difficulty

*Does the mathematics difficulty align with what the team defined? How? Why?*

Architect of Goo provides a challenge with various levels of difficulty within the gems that can be increased gradually over time. However, the GDD does not strictly outline whether there's a progression in how the skill gems are obtained; whether they're all available at the start, or as the player progresses through levels, more become available. This sort of progression is key to how the difficulty of the mathematics play out - learning intercepts generally happens after learning how linear functions work to begin with. If this is clarified, then Architect of Goo aligns in math difficulty with the team definition.

#### Accessibility

*Is the game accessible as defined by the team? Why? How?*

The game does not require a lot of extensive hardware; the style is simplistic and the required animations, effects and other polish are deliberately limited in scope so the game can run on any machine from a web browser. Important to keep in mind in later development is to not go overboard - simplicity often pushes people in the direction of doing more elaborate things with simple items, but it must be kept in mind that this game is meant to be simple. 

As stated above, the gradual introduction of the mechanics might not be as present; in general, this game is better suited to those already familiar with all concepts regarding linear functions so it can be enjoyed at its full capacity. New concepts are not taught, but the game offers a very suitable practice space.

The other gameplay is straightfoward and easy to understand. The lack of time limitation and the lenience in returning to checkpoints allows even non-gamers to play it and not get too frustrated. However, the game is likely to draw in more students who are experienced with games and play them as a hobby rather than newcomers to the media.

#### Core Values

##### Client Design Values

- Gameplay is entertainment first, education second
  - Fulfilled; the game's design is focused around the fun-factor, with the mechanics adapted around linear functions. The game doesn't hide it is trying to practice linear functions with the player, but has 'disguised' them into a digestable, fun experience.

- Complexity around linear functions is scalable
  - Fullfilled - new concepts around linear functions can be introduced in the gameplay in the form of new gems or new obstacles for the player to work around. Other concepts surrounding functions can also be introduced. Already present mechanics can be scaled in difficulty in both how they need to be applied in a puzzle, but also in how the player interacts with them.

- Gameplay needs to be validated through play tests by external players
  - Testing is planned.

- Target audience, aged 12 to 16, level VWO
  - Fulfilled.

- Gameplay is adaptable so it can be used inside and outside of the classroom
  - Fulfilled to a degree; this mostly presents itself in the ability of a teacher to design their own levels to supplement their own curriculum. Beyond this, the game's design is so that it *could* be used in a classroom, but is likely better suited as a supplementary activity.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  - Fulfilled, the control scheme is straightfoward, understandable, and the graphical requirements aren't too high, allowing it to run on web smoothly.

- Authorability should be a key element
  - The level structure and level creator allow for teachers to create their own levels and thus approaches for a player to take. This gives them options on how to integrate the game within their curriculums, fulfilling the requirement for authorability.

##### Team Design Values

- Linear algebra has to be incorporated in the design of the core gameplay loop
  - Fulfilled; all aspects of traversing the level's obstacles involve linear algebra in some way.

- Fun has to be considered over education in design
  - Fulfilled; the game's design is focused around the fun-factor, with the mechanics adapted around linear functions. The game doesn't hide it is trying to practice linear functions with the player, but has 'disguised' them into a digestable, fun experience

- The game develops an understanding of the algebra it attempts to teach
  -  Depending on how the mechanics are introduced and what the difficulty scaling is, this is fulfilled. This should be kept in mind in level designs going forward.

- Accessible and designed to be easy to pick up
  - Mostly fulfilled; the control scheme is easy to grasp and very straightforward, and the design of the UI makes approaching the mechanics simple. However, it does require some level of understanding of the math concepts the mechanics use, or else the player might end up lost.

- Concept is scalable in complexity
  - Fullfilled - new concepts around linear functions can be introduced in the gameplay in the form of new gems or new obstacles for the player to work around. Other concepts surrounding functions can also be introduced. Already present mechanics can be scaled in difficulty in both how they need to be applied in a puzzle, but also in how the player interacts with them.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  - Fulfilled, the control scheme is straightfoward, understandable, and the graphical requirements aren't too high, allowing it to run on web smoothly.

### Game Lenses

#### Lens of Flow

*Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?*
- The player's goal is to reach the end of the level and to head home, and this is clear in the structure.

*Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?*
- The player's goal to finish the level and complete their math tasks aligns with that of the overal narrative; to go home. 

*Do parts of the game distract players so they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?*
- Some additional extras might incentivise the player to stray from the goal to explore the level more. To some degree, there has to be a reward for this in place if it is something that is desired to be kept - if the player discovers a new place, and gets a coin, is there something they can do with this coin? Is there a reason to find this?

*Does my game provide a steady stream of gradually increasing challenges?*
- The mathematics increasingly becomes more difficult, new concepts are introduced, and the levels are scalable in difficulty and overal size, providing a nice curve in difficulty that continue to challenge the player as they go along.

*Are the player's skills improving as expected? If not, how can I change that?*
- Depending on the structure of the levels per world, the skill increase might be lacking. Important is to keep pacing well; though this is a concern for later iterations and after more testing of the individual gems and corrosponding mechanics.

#### Lens of Skill

*What skills does my game require from the player?*
- The game requires the player to have knowledge of linear functions, as well as some understanding of how games are played on a basic level. The gameplay is straightforward beyond this.

*Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?*
- The game poses itself as a platformer, but misses some platforming elements and focuses very heavily on just using math skills as mechanics. Some basic platforming skills as a hook for the player could be introduced, make the game feel more like a game.

*Which skills are dominant?*
- Math skills are highly dominant in the gameplay loop. Every aspect of moving through the level successfully beyond the basic movement left and right requires the player to think about a math concept and apply that to the game.

*Are these skills creating the experience I want?*
- As the game is a serious game intended for the player to practice their math skills in a playful way, yes; the skills required of the player mold the intended experience quite well. 

*Are some players much better at these skills than others?*
- It is inevitable that players have a difference in math skills, or game skills. The lack of time pressure, as well as the room for new attempts due to the placement of checkpoints, as well as the sliamond in the rough mechanic, are very valuable in this regard, giving the player opportunities to still progress, even if it is in a slower fashion or with some training wheels attached.

*Does this make the game feel unfair?*
- The game does not have a competitive angle. Players do not play against each other - they can aid each other if necessary, but there is no way one can beat the other by being better at math. This makes the game feel plenty fair. There is no rush or pressure to perform well, just to practice, learn, and progress at their own pace.

*Can players improve their skills with practice?*
- Yes; the game provides plenty of 'do overs' so the player has ample opportunity to learn their errors and how to fix these. There might be a necessity for the player to practice their math skills outside of the game in order to fully grasp the mechanics - it might be worth to revisit this in future iterations.

*Does this game demand the right level of skill?*
- Yes, *if* these skills are introduced in a way that is well-paced. It is important to facillitate growth in the way the levels are structured; if gems are introduced too quickly, the learning curve might end up really steep and demand a higher level of skill than is reasonable.

#### Concept Dependent Lenses

[10]The Lens of Holographic Design
*What elements of the game make the experience enjoyable?*
- The narrative, as well as the visuals, play a big part in the initial hook for the game - making players see past the 'math game' aspect of it all. The large variety of mechanics in the gems, as well as the ability to constantly introduce new levels, keep the player engaged and interested in playing the game. As their skills refine, the game becomes more and more fun to play each time.

*What elements may detract from the experience?*
- The pacing and structure of the levels might be too overwhelming all at once - it does require a rather expansive knowledge of math concepts in order to use all mechanics to their full potential. In addition, having to consider what mechanic to use might be too much for a player if they're also trying to grasp the concept to begin with.

*How can I change game elements to improve the experience?*
- Pacing is key; how the mechanics are introduced and perhaps also get more difficult over time is important to consider, especially in the level designs. If this is done well, the steep learning curve can be levelled out and feel more of a challenge to overcome rather than a test. Giving more guidance at first and then putting players in a position where they have to make the choices themselves could also help.

[24] The Lens of Novelty
*What is novel about my game?*
- The constant introduction of new gems - mechanics - introducing new level structures and allowing the player to play around with new ways of progressing. On top of that, the way the math is incorporated in the game is rather novel by itself, a new and interesting thing for the player to do their homework.

*Does my game have novelties throughout or just at the beginning?*
- Granted the pacing is done well, the game constantly introduces new mechanics for the player to enjoy. There is dropoff eventually, having no more new things to introduce - but if paced well, this dropoff won't be reached for a while.

*Do I have the right mix of the novel and the familiar?*
- This also depends on level structure. It is important to not hyperfixate on newly introduced gems, but keep older kinds of gems scattered throughout. This is also a good callback to revisit older concepts, from an educational standpoint.

*When the novelty wears off, will players still enjoy my game?*
- Considering the wide possibilities of level design, adding to the existing pool of levels, or even content updates as time goes on, this game continues to be interesting for people who grasp the mechanics. It provides new puzzles each time for the player to solve and consider and keeps the game enjoyable; however it might not be as interesting outside of a math class. While the mechanics are interesting challenges on their own, the math aspect might be too much to continue being interesting after the subject has been closed in a school setting.

### Dynamics & Aesthetics

Challenge
  > We want our player to be challenged by the gameplay and the math aspect. The player should use his grey brain cells to solve the equations and by extension the levels
  - Fulfilled. Within the design, there's a lot of consideration on how to approach challenges for the player - in both the level design as a whole, and mechanics by themselves by giving them difficulty increases. In some areas there might be just a bit too much challenge; keep this in mind in later iterations for design to pace the player and give them the space to grow and learn. 

Discovery
  > We want our player to use his curiosity and creativity to discover different possibilities to solve the level and to advance through the game by trial and error
  - Fulfilled. This is very well facilitated by the use of checkpoints and the structure of being level-based. There's room to make mistakes without being punished too hard; there's help if there's a struggle so the player can learn more. There could be different ways of solving levels, giving room for a lot of expression and experimentation to try and make things work.

  Fantasy could also be a very worthwhile addition to the aesthetics as the narrative and the world setting play a big part of the game's overal presentation to the player. You are a cute little slime, interacting with the world in a slimey way; the narrative and mechanics are intertwined and can be highlighted as such.

## Concept 6: Slope Swing

### Core Ideas and Values

#### Serious Games

Definition: A game intending on teaching the player a concept or skill applicable in the real world.

Slope Swing is a game intended to get students involved in mathematics in a playful, engaging way. It does not teach these concepts on its own, but rather provides a supplementary activity to lessons in order to strengthen newfound knowledge. It involves *all* students in a classroom activity, taking a break from monotony of class and creating a fun space for the player to learn in, providing a newer and fresher environment.

The game does not teach however and the player's interactions with linear functions are rather limited in scope. Slope Swing really is a game about reinforcing knowledge and practicing it in a playful environment as a supplement. 

#### Content

##### Learning Content

1. ~~Playing with the fundamental characteristics of a linear function first individually and then in combination.~~
    - While crossed out fully, the game does allow for playing with the fundemantal characteristics of a linear function individually, albeit only the a value in a y = ax + b equation.
2. Applying the fundamental characteristics to transform one representation (verbal, graph, formula, table) into another in a playful way.
    - Fulfilled, as the player has to edit a function to get a graph line to aim their golf ball. These are, however, the only representations present in the game.
3. Solving quests, tasks and problems involving multiple representations of linear function (verbal, graph, formula, table).
    - Fulfilled, as the player has to edit a function to get a graph line to aim their golf ball, but again these are the only representations in the game.
4. ~~Applying properties of linear functions to solve equations in a playful way.~~
    - Not applied.
5. Applying the appropriate function representation to solve a question or problem in the game.
    - Partially fulfilled seeing as the player has to adapt a function to aim the ball, but they are not offered various representations of the graph to pick a correct one.

##### Game Content

*How does the game include narrative, art, sound and further game and or level design?*

The game does not require many objects in order to function, as the game has no real plot or story. For the most part, it relies on the player's desire to perform well in the game and be on a leaderboard with their peers - the drive to compete. The gameplay is in itself simple, trying to putt a ball in the least amount of strokes. The players do not interact with each other on the field, unless they are giving aid through phone-a-friend, but the competition is entirely driven by their own performance and their wishes for how well they do. The simple structure of the game lends well to this, as there aren't many systems or objects to keep track of while the player does their thing. 

Visually and in terms of audio, the game has to be eye-catching and interesting without being too repetitive. Keeping a simple, bold style works well, but must not be too childish. The linked example of Golf Story does this well - simple, without being too childlike and risking a patronizing simplicity.

#### Scalability

*How does the scalability show in this game? Can the concept be applied to multiple Learning Goals? Does the content and duration of the game allow to be expand upon in the future?*

As the concept is right now, the scalability is limited. There are no other described ways of putting, meaning the player only has the ability to put through editing the function. This means that other learning goals can't be applied very well, or be applied in a limited capacity due to the nature of the graphics. While the game's difficulty could scale in the way the courses are designed, the math difficulty would not scale much if at all - though this is not defined.

The game could have more scalability introduced, but it would require a slight change of world interaction as well. Different ways of aiming could pose different challenges, like Golf With Friends does with different shaped 'golf balls'. 

#### Adaptability

*Does it align with how the team defined adaptability? Is it an adaptable game? How? Why?*

Slope Swing lends itself best to a classroom environment, wrapping up a lesson and drawing the attention from the students back to the learning material. The activity is entirely class-based, led by a teacher with as many students as possible participating to get a large result board going and motivating students to try harder on their next attempt to reach higher on another leaderboard. 

This game could technically be played outside of class as well, instigated by students on their own time, but would likely not find much traction this way as the mechanics are still very simple and based around mathematics. While it has a lot of draw in the classroom, outside it would fall a little short. With it needing at least a host and then a separate player, the game requires a larger group to be played and outside of a classroom environment, this will be harder to facilitate. 

A potentially larger issue with Slope Swing is the limitations of its mechanics. With how the design is set up right now, it only allows for one mechanic in aiming; adjusting the function, but only one element thereof. This means that the game isn't likely to be useful across the curriculum for linear equations, but would only provide an engaging way to lay the foundations and not much else. 

#### Difficulty

##### Game Difficulty

**Definition**: The level of challenge the game content presents.

The progression of the difficulty in courses is not clearly defined; however there is a difficulty setting visible on the UI screens, meaning that the teacher can determine the difficulty of the courses. Generally, the mechanics of the game are very simple and the trajectory of the ball is not only displayed, but can be somewhat predicted based on the speed the player hits the ball with. They are not too difficult to understand and step into. Whether the game gets more difficult over time is not too clear, but if applied, should be a gradual scale without a spike too high that makes the game frustrating to play.

The secret hole might be a slight point of frustration if it is too difficult to find. The placement should make sense for a player to search at without being too arbitrary - otherwise, this turns from a point of skill to randomly putting until the secret hole is hit.

##### Mathematics Difficulty

*Does the mathematics difficulty align with what the team defined? How? Why?*

**Definition**: The level of challenge the learning content presents.

The learning content in this game is rather limited in the way it is currently described. There is only one way of interacting with linear functions, and that method remains throughout the game. It does not scale in difficulty outside of requiring more precision if the courses get harder. This leaves the usability of this game in the context of a classroom or a curriculum rather limited. It serves well as an introductory game after the topic is first discussed in class, and some initial practice, but outside of that has little merit as a teaching or practicing tool. 

#### Accessibility

*Is the game accessible as defined by the team? Why? How?*

**Definition**: The player can play the game regardless of their mathematical skills, game skills and hardware.

- Math skills: The math required of this game is very low-entry and can be picked up easily, allowing many different skill levels to interact with the game right off the bat. It does not introduce any new concepts outside of the one they are given right away.
- Game skills: Golf games are easy to pick up, as their mechanics and how the world interacts with itself is very akin to real life, giving a good deal of predictablity to the player's actions. Some courses might require more skill and fine-tuning, but not in a capacity that gamers would have an advantage over non-game enthusiasts.
- Hardware: The mechanics and the graphical requirements lend well to any kind of hardware. The UI might need adjustments to play well on a mobile device, but this is not something that cannot be mitigated. There are plenty of golf games for phones that can be referenced.

#### Core Values

##### Client Design Values

*Does the game align with the client design values? How? Why?*

- Gameplay is entertainment first, education second
  - Fulfilled; the game focuses on a fun classroom experience that everyone can share in a positive way. Math is there, and it is not hidden in any way, but it is shaped in a way that is intended to be entertaining rather than overtly educational.

- Complexity around linear functions is scalable
  - Not fulfilled; the way linear functions are interacted with and applied remains the same across the game and the way the mechanics are currently designed, do not allow for much change or scaling.

- Gameplay needs to be validated through play tests by external players
  - Playtesting is not scheduled for this concept due to time constraints.

- Target audience, aged 12 to 16, level VWO
  - Fulfilled, but would be more suited for the lower ages of this bracket.

- Gameplay is adaptable so it can be used inside and outside of the classroom
  - Not fulfilled; the game really only lends itself to a classroom use due to the lobby system, phone-a-friend, and leaderboards. The game could be played by students on their own incentive, but is not likely to find much traction this way.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  - Fulfilled; the graphics are simple and the control scheme can be applied across devices. UI and layout might need some adjusting, but this is a minor issue.

- Authorability should be a key element
  - Not fulfilled. The teacher can set the difficulty of the game in lobby, but in what way this would be more difficult, or how the player interacts with linear functions, cannot be specified at all.

##### Team Design Values

*Does the game align with the team design values? How? Why?*

- Linear algebra has to be incorporated in the design of the core gameplay loop
  - Fulfilled; the main gameplay is centered around aiming using linear equations. 

- Fun has to be considered over education in design
  - Fulfilled; the game focuses on a fun classroom experience that everyone can share in a positive way. Math is there, and it is not hidden in any way, but it is shaped in a way that is intended to be entertaining rather than overtly educational.

- The game develops an understanding of the algebra it attempts to teach
  - Somewhat fulfilled; the way the player adjusts the linear function may not make it much of a teaching moment rather than a visual explanation of a linear function. This does however allow for a greater understanding in how linear functions work at the core and train the player to visually recognize a linear function in a graph, as well as what its associated function would be.

- Accessible and designed to be easy to pick up
  - Mechanics are simple to understand for gamers and non-gamers alike. The math is similarly not to difficult to step into, all of which makes it accessible to get into and play.

- Concept is scalable in complexity
  - Not fulfilled; the way linear functions are interacted with and applied remains the same across the game and the way the mechanics are currently designed, do not allow for much change or scaling. The courses could become considerably more difficult over time, but this is not clearly specified in the concept currently.

- Game needs to be designed for web
  -  Fulfilled; the graphics are simple and the control scheme can be applied across devices. UI and layout might need some adjusting, but this is a minor issue.

### Game Lenses

#### Lens of Flow

*Does my game have clear goals? If not, how can I fix that?*

Yes, the game has a clear goal. It is not that clear how or if the player should try to reach the secret hole.

*Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?*

Yes, the goal is to complete the level before any of your friends and get the highest score.

*Do parts of the game distract players so they forget their goal? If so, can these distractions be reduced, or tied into the game goals?*

The road to the normal hole is very clear-cut and easy to understand, however it is not clear as to why or how the player is supposed to reach the secret hole.

*Does my game provide a steady stream of gradually increasing challenges?*

As of now the game is very simplistic and it has not been described clearly how the difficulty progresses.

*Are the player's skills improving as expected? If not, how can I change that?*

It is not clearly explained how the player's skills are supposed to progress, i.e. only one level has been described not the future progression. 
- How does the math get more difficult? 
- How does the game get more difficult? 
- What skills is the player supposed to learn?

#### Lens of Skill

*What skills does my game require from the player?*

The game requires a basic understanding of lineair equations and how they work. The player does not have to have much knowledge regarding games as the gameplay itself is very simplistic.

*Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?*

The game is very simplistic, and it is unsure of how it can/will be expanded upon. 

*Which skills are dominant?*

It is vital that the player can see the entire course whenever they'd like so they can adjust the function properly. The player most likely has to have a good idea about how the ball is going to bounce of from the walls of the course and can properly estimate at what angle the ball needs to hit the wall. So in short it's best if the player has a keen eye and a good gut feeling.

*Are these skills creating the experience I want?*

Yes, these skills are allowing the player to reach a higher score and compete with their friends.

*Are some players much better at these skills than others?*

Yes there is likely to be a difference in skills between students, in how they perform math, and how good they are at estimating the right angle/power.

*Does this make the game feel unfair?*

*Can players improve their skills with practice?*

*Does this game demand the right level of skill?*

[59] Control

### Dynamics & Aesthetics

*Are the proposed aesthetics achieved with the current mechanics? Do the dynamics support the aesthetics? Do you agree with the proposed explanation in the GDD?* 

- **Challenge**: Game as obstacle course
  > The game needs to provide a challenge to the students. They need the option of competing with each other.
  The game presents a golf course where all the students can play with each other. They don't compete with each other directly as they cannot influence each others shots / balls, instead they compete in 3 different categories for the title. Even for players who are struggling with the game there is help in form of friends who can help them make it after they finished their round. The challenge can be increased with harder courses, adding to that the player can never shoot straight up or down due to the nature of linear equations.

- **Fellowship**: Game as social framework 
  > The game needs to connect the students in the classroom. A feeling of comradery or chaos should be present.
  The game fosters a social framework because it will be played in the classroom where, like kahoot!. It is the part to all the students look forward to because they can relax for a moment and play a game, the same feeling can be evoked with this game. It is even stronger because all the players sit in one room instead of the usual solo gaming experience, where you play online with friends who might not even be in the same country as the player. There is also the possibility to help your friends if they struggle with their put, which also plays into the social framework.

- **Discovery**: Game as uncharted territory
  > The game needs to let players discover. For those who want to explore deeper than the surface.
  There are options to explore, but the implementation does not tap into the full potential this idea has. There are secret holes that the players can explore and finish the level this way. There is a feeling of discovery attached to that but it can be explored more.
