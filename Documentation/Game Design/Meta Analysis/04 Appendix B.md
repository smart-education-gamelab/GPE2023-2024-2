## I. Criteria

### A. Serious Game

We evaluate whether the game concept aligns with the defined characteristics of a serious game, balancing educational content and engaging gameplay.

1. Does the game align with our definition of a serious game?
2. How does it incorporate educational and entertainment elements?
3. Why is it considered a serious game according to our criteria?

### B. Content

`Learning Content`

This aspect assesses the proper integration of educational material within the game to ensure that learning objectives are met effectively.

1. Is the learning content incorporated effectively?
2. How is the educational material embedded within the gameplay?
3. Why is this integration effective or not?

The learning goals which the game should meet are as follows:

1. Playing with the fundamental characteristics of a linear function first individually and then in combination.
2. Applying the fundamental characteristics to translate one representation (graph, formula, table) into another in a playful way.
3. Solving quests, tasks and problems involving multiple representations of linear function (graph, formula).
4. Applying properties of linear functions to solve equations in a playful way.
5. Applying the appropriate function representation to solve a question or problem in the game.

`Game Content`

We evaluate the inclusion and quality of narrative, art, sound, and level design within the game.

1. How does the game include narrative, art, sound, and level design?
2. Are these elements cohesive and do they enhance the overall gaming experience?

### C. Scalability

We examine the potential for the game to scale in complexity and content, ensuring it can adapt to multiple learning goals and future expansions.

1. How is scalability demonstrated in the game?
2. Can the concept be applied to various learning goals?
3. Does the game content and duration allow for future expansion?

### D. Adaptability

This ensures that the game can adapt to different educational settings and student needs as defined by the team.

1. Does the game align with our definition of adaptability?
2. How and why is the game adaptable?
3. In what ways can it be customised or adjusted for different contexts?

### E. Difficulty

`Game Difficulty`

We assess whether the game's difficulty aligns with the team’s predefined levels, ensuring it is appropriately challenging.

1. Does the game difficulty align with our definitions?
2. How is the difficulty structured and why does it fit our criteria?

`Mathematics Difficulty`

This evaluates whether the difficulty of the mathematical content matches the intended educational level and goals.

1. Is the mathematics difficulty appropriate for our target audience?
2. How does it align with our educational objectives?

### F. Accessibility

We ensure that the game is accessible to all users regardless of their mathematical skills, game skills and hardware.

1. Is the game accessible according to our definitions?
2. How is accessibility achieved?
3. Why is the game considered accessible or not?

### G. Core Values

`Client Design Values`

We verify that the game aligns with the client's design values and requirements.

1. Does the game align with the client's design values?
2. How and why does it meet these values?

The client's design values are as follows:

- Gameplay is entertainment first, education second
- Complexity around linear functions is scalable
- Gameplay needs to be validated through play tests by external players
- Target audience, aged 12 to 16, level VWO
- Gameplay is adaptable so it can be used inside and outside of the classroom
- Game needs to be designed for web
- Authorability should be a key element

`Team Design Values`

We ensure that the game aligns with the team’s internal design values, promoting consistency and quality.

1. Does the game align with the team’s design values?
2. How and why does it meet these values?

The team's design values are as follows:

- Linear algebra has to be incorporated in the design of the core gameplay loop
- Fun has to be considered over education in design
- The game develops an understanding of the algebra it attempts to teach
- Accessible and designed to be easy to pick up
- Concept is scalable in complexity
- Game needs to be designed for web

### H. Game Lenses

`Lens of Flow`

This lens examines whether the game maintains player engagement through clear goals and a steady progression of challenges.

1. Does the game have clear goals?
2. Are the player's goals aligned with the intended goals?
3. Are there distractions that could detract from these goals?
4. Does the game provide a steady stream of increasing challenges?
5. Are the player's skills improving as expected?

`Lens of Skill`

This evaluates the skills required by the game and their impact on the player experience.

1. What skills does the game require?
2. Are there missing skill categories?
3. Which skills are dominant and why?
4. Do these skills create the desired experience?
5. Is there a disparity in skill levels among players?
6. Does this disparity affect the game's fairness?
7. Can players improve their skills with practice?
8. Does the game demand the right level of skill?

`Concept Dependent Lenses`

We select 1 to 5 relevant lenses specific to the game concept and answer their associated questions to provide a comprehensive evaluation.

1. Are we able to answer these questions clearly?
2. Do they provide a clear view of the game and gameplay?

### I. Dynamics & Aesthetics

We evaluate whether the proposed aesthetics are effectively achieved through current game mechanics and dynamics.

1. Are the proposed aesthetics achieved with the current mechanics?
2. Do the dynamics support the intended aesthetics?
3. Do we agree with the explanations provided in the Game Design Document (GDD)?
