## Concept 1: Angry Equations

### Context

#### Concept

Angry equations presents the player with the challenge of solving levels by shooting projectiles using linear equations. The game is inspired by the popular game Angry Birds and aims to teach the player about linear equations in a fun and engaging way.

#### Hypotheses

We believe that the player will have a positive experience with the game and will be able to learn about linear equations in a fun and engaging way. The player will be able to connect the input they provide to the output on the screen and will be able to finish the levels within a set amount of time.

### Analysis

#### Functionality

- Unintended Behaviour
    - Each tester encountered at least 1 to 3 bugs on average. One tester experienced 3 or more bugs during the gameplay. 
    
    - The most encountered bug was that the enemies / balls rolled out of the frame or out of reach for the cannon because we had no invisible walls. That resulted in the player not being able to finish the level so they had to restart. Sometimes the enemies also did not die on impact or collision with the bomb or other objects, but this bug is rather rare. The testers were not able to finish the levels due to the bugs, which in turn hindered their gameplay.

- Goal Hindrance
    - Almost all of the encountered bugs, hindered gameplay in some kind of form. The players weren't able to finish the levels because the balls rolled out of the screen or behind the cannon. On top of that the collisions with other objects sometimes resulted in the targets (balls) being launched (yeeted) at high speed. The targets (balls) did not behave has the testers expected.

#### Accessibility

- Control Clarity
    - Most of the players were pretty fast in picking up how the controls work and figured it out in 10 seconds or less. There are also some players who struggled more and needed some more time. 

- UI clarity and simplicity
    - The testers were easily able to open the level within their first few clicks. The testers that used more clicks tried to open the settings before starting the level, increasing the number of clicks performed from 2 to 4 clicks. 

    - The majority of the players were able to figure out how the UI works on their own, without asking for help. Some of the testers were a bit confused and asked only once for guidance.

#### User Experience

- Fun
    - Most of the players did not actively ask after the test to continue the game. Two of the players wanted to continue to play, and asked the conductor of the test, if they could.
    
    - Although most of the players, did not ask themselves to continue, as stated in the question above, once asked most of them would continue once specifically asked. Only 1 of the 14 testers of them would not continue to play.

- Sense of urgency
    - Most of the players did not feel time pressure to finish the game. The two testers who said that they were feeling time pressure said that it was due to the fact that they were running out of ammo and were unsure about what would happen, and that something could suddenly disappear. 

- Satisfaction
    - Some testers experienced a difficulty curve in the game, they experienced the game to be more difficult at the beginning and had to perform some trial and error. Once they understood the goal and controls of the game they understood the game better (spel beter). Overall the testers experienced the game as fun (leuk).

    - Most of the testers experienced the game as fun (leuk) and responded positively when asked if they felt satisfied. They expressed that their experience improved due to the connection between input and visual representation. It was expressed that the future experience could improve even more if the enemies were not just simple balls (een vormpje), there were things to unlock such as skins for the player, and the final kill was completely visible. 
    
- Challenge
    - The beginning of the game was a bit challenging as the testers had to figure out what they were supposed to do. Once they figured out  the controls and their goal the game became a lot easier.
    
#### Didactic Efficacy

- Learning objectives alignment
  - Most testers understood that the game allowed them to alter something. Some testers understood that the game had to do with formulas (formules), linear equations and/or functions. However most could not narrow it down to linear equations.
  
- Assessment of knowledge acquisition
  - It is almost a 50% chance if the players are able to finish the first level within a minute. If you look at the actual time the testers achieved, most of them are scattered around the 60 seconds mark. Some of them were slightly faster and some of them a bit slower. There were some testers that took way longer, around 2 to 3 minutes, that was partially due to the bugs, and the testers having to redo the level in order to progress to the second level. These testers were not the target audience. The target audience was consistently around the 60 seconds mark with slight differences.

  - As in the previous level, 50% of the players were able to finish the game in 50 seconds or less and 50% took more time. Also in this level, the bugs made a huge difference in how fast the players were able to finish because the enemy balls would sometimes roll out of reach and the level had to be restarted. The range of how long the testers had to finish the level reaches from from 25sec up to 7min. This number is skewed by the guerilla testing because the target audiences range is around 25sec up to 2min. 
  
- Tutorial and guidance options
  - Most of the testers, made use of the tutorials in the game. The tutorial refers to the trajectory which the bullet takes once fired. Only one tester did not make use of this, but was rather confused about how the whole game works.
    
- Engagement with educational content & expression
    - Only 1 of the 14 testers would not continue to play the game for just the gameplay. However all 14 testers would continue the game to improve their math skills. Some stated that it would be easier to learn (makkelijker leren, zou helpen) due to the game being more visual, and being more fun (leuk) than learning from a book (schrift).

#### Game Flow

- Complete concentration on the task
    - As an interruption of the gameplay counts if the tester would interact with someone outside of the test, like a friend or a bystander. But none of the testers would let themselves be distracted.

- Clarity of goals
    - Most of the testers asked 1 to 3 questions and one person had more questions. The questions range from "What do I need to do?" down to "What are bananas?" or "How is the score calculated?".

- Effortlessness and ease
    - To find out if the players can get into the gameplay with ease, we set up a benchmark in which we tested if the player could hit an enemy within their first try of using the cannon. And around 60% of the testers managed to do that. The others were confused about what the goal was and sometimes tried to shoot over the obstacles and structures to try not to break anything.

- Balance between challenge and skills
    - Out of the 14 testers only 4 made a remark during gameplay. The game is perceived to be inconsistent/random, one of the 4 testers deemed the game to be unbalanced and misaligned due to the expected trajectory and behaviour of the player's character. 2 Out of the 4 testers claimed the game to be easy as well. On top of that one tester had difficulty to see the trajectory due to the UI (it was in the way), which made the game more difficult in the beginning.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the game is very well received by the testers, especially by the target audience. They were very interested in the game, and did not have a lot of trouble finding out how they should interact with the game. The controls were easy to pick up for most testers, but the biggest point of confusion was that there was no clear goal stated. A lot of the testers did not know what to do. They started shooting over the obstacles and did some trial and error before they understood what they needed to do. The UI had elements to indicate the amount of remaining ammo and enemies, but it was not easy to find for the players as some of them were confused as to why they failed a level. The target audience had a positive experience and stated it out loud several times. They were fond of the experience and encourage each other to test the prototype. The children were quick to figure out how the controls work and were not afraid to perform some trial and error, by trying things out and see where they would be lead. They did mention that it was difficult to see the connection between the linear equation and the actual gameplay. They did not really used the function to aim but rather as a visual queue to see where they should aim. On top of that they used the buttons to aim and did not spent much time thinking about how the equation was changed in the graph. According to the testers the game is simple and interesting as it keeps the player engaged and is easy to complete. On top of that it was mentioned that the game was fun to play.

### Recommendations

According to the results the following has been recommended:

- *UI*: The UI can make or break this experience. The goal needs to be introduced more clearly because the testers were confused about what they were supposed to do. This can for example be accomplished by implementing a small trailer, making the enemies look and feel more threatening or showing pop-ups with clear information on what to do. There should be more visual feedback for the player to truly understand what is happening, for example the bullets could explode on impact. Without this visual representation it was confusing for the player because the enemies and obstacles would sometimes be pushed to the side. There was confusion about what objects were interactive, what objects could a bullet destroy, both of which could also be improved by adding polish to the game. 
- *Story*: The players were confused about why there were bananas, this is due to the fact that the rating system is based on the story which is not implemented into the prototype yet. On top of that they were not sure as to why they needed to shoot the enemies/targets.
- *Progression*: The game has the potential to be very useful for younger students who just got an introduction to linear functions. On top of that it can be adjusted for more advanced students, for example they could write the entire function themselves instead of just clicking on the buttons to change the trajectory. All of the test players were fond of the experience and would continue playing, if the levels were more balanced and more difficult. For example the math was very simplistic as of now and they were unsure as to how this could be made more difficult over time.
- *Authorability*: This concept is not fitted for being authorable by the teacher, because the levels need to be set up in a specific way for the player to be able to actually win the game, which takes a lot of time. The children can complete the levels in multiple different ways which lies in the nature of this game. There is no one correct answer, which might not be completely in the interest of the teachers who would probably prefer a one true answer. 

## Concept 2: Myth Digger

### Context

#### Concept

The player is someone who intends to find the supposed answer to the dying planet under the crust. Doing so will require the gathering of materials so they can craft tools necessary to dig further and be able to find the answers you're looking for. Building rails, processing ores, and using them in crafting allows you to progress through the game by digging deeper each time.
The game has a side view and the depths are dark. The light source is glowing gems that you can mine and use motes of to light up the path you're mining.

#### Hypotheses

Because the game has been designed with fun in mind, we expect that the player finds the mechanics enjoyable to interact with, pulling them in for further exploration. Unfortunately, as it is only a prototype to a proof of concept, aspects of the final gameplay are lacking, which makes this compared to its entire design not a fully reliable test as a vertical slice would. It does, however, provide insight to the core mechanics and the core loop.

We believe that with how the game pacing is laid out, the game is accessible and understandable for the player to step into and grasp both the mechanics, but also the mathematics within those. 

Expected feedback is that laying down the tracks is tedious and takes too much time. This is based on previous tests with other concepts, revealing actions to be repetitive without that being a consideration by the designer originally. Additionally, the fact this game is only a prototype so far can be another issue with pacing; we do expect the player to wander around rather aimlessly in the beginning due to lack of initial guidance.

### Analysis

> Describe & summarise the key findings per subject based on the test plan and `03 Data Collection & Analysis`

#### Functionality

- Unintended Behaviour
> During playtesting, there were some bugs that did hinder playtesting. Particularly two instances of crashes that ended playtesting entirely, closing out of the game and erasing all progress. Other issues were that the rail track did not have to align at the end of the tunnel and game progression was not reset properly returning to the main menu. A minor issue of being able to jump infinitely in the mineshaft also came up.

- Goal Hindrance
> The two crashes are obvious detriments to the experience and the playtesting overal, completely interrupting progress and being unable to finish the playtests. The bug of the progression not being reset also caused issues during the playtest progression, effectively cutting off one area of the game to be tested.
> The lack of track alignment and the infinite jumping glitches would be issues in an isolated context - for the playtest, however, the authors could direct the tester to progress normally.

#### Accessibility

- Control Clarity
> Unilaterally, all testers were able to figure out the control scheme within 10 seconds. Only in the railtrack placing was some confusion; the lack of the popup on R later on in the tunnel made some testers not realize they had to continue pressing R and place more tracks. 

- UI clarity and simplicity
> Reading the popups on locked areas was enough for players to continue exploring and try to find out what the game wanted them to do instead. Some lack of clarity appeared during the crafting sections where players were confused on having to select which area to fill in and then click on the intended answer. The ores listed on the blueprint selection were confusing as well, making players unsure of where to click or if they had to do anything with it at all.

#### User Experience

- Fun
> The target group testers expressed that they enjoyed the game quite a bit and had fun; most guerilla testers agreed, though some remarked that the nature of it being a prototype hindered their overal experience.

- Sense of urgency
> No testers experienced a sense of urgency while playing based on the game itself - one tester remarked they felt pressured, but only because they were being observed.

- Satisfaction
> Testers across both guerilla and target audience remarked feeling satisfied playing the game and would enjoy to play it further. Those that were more negative made comments on the lack of reward and progression - this is largely due to the nature of the prototype and difficult to avoid in this stage of development.

- Challenge
> The feedback on challenge was more mixed. Many stated that the gameplay was not too overly challenging but it had potential; one pointed out specifically it felt like a tutorial level rather than a part of the game. The target audience largely did not find the general gameplay challenging but some did have a hard time with the math aspect, particulary the processing and crafting. Likely, this is because the target audience testing was just a smidge too young and thus not that far ahead in mathematics to be familiar with the concepts introduced.

#### Didactic Efficacy

- Learning objectives alignment
> Most players experienced all 5 learning goals aside from the few that were unable to finish the game because of time constraint/bugs and crashes.

- Assessment of knowledge acquisition
> Most players were able to somewhat describe the type of math concepts in the game but none actually listed 'linear equations'.

- Engagement with educational content
> None of the players were able to complete mining within 2 minutes. 4 out of the 13 players finished processing within 45 seconds. 3 out of 11 finished crafting within 35 seconds while reading coordinates and none out of the 9 players that finished the workbench doing the calculation were able to do it within a minute. From observation, this could to a degree be attributed to two things: lack of guidance in the mechanics, and lack of sufficient math skill.

- Tutorial and guidance options
> N/A

- Expression
> Some players expressed themselves by using larger 'a' values to cover more ground quickly. Others jumped to place the track higher rather than adjust the 'b' value manually. This is unintended in design, but an interesting approach by the players nonetheless.

#### Game Flow

- Complete concentration on the task
> Once the players sunk their teeth into a task, they were not interrupted or distracted.

- Clarity of goals
> The goals were not clear, nearly every player needed to be guided by the observer at some point, needing to be directed to the next objective. At the railtrack placement this was especially prevalent, either asking for help or getting stuck and needing to be pointed to the right mechanics by the observer.

- Effortlessness and ease
> Some players expressed confusion regarding the control scheme. They expected to be able to jump with the 'spacebar' but they were required to use 'WASD' for all movement. Some attempted to use the arrow keys to walk around rather than WASD, and needed to be pointed to the correct keys. There were some issues with the rail placement key after it no longer showed on screen, and some struggled with the identification of which part of the table was being filled in.

- Balance between challenge and skills
> There is a steep increase in challenge after the player is done with laying down tracks and going into the workshop. Some testers were taken aback by the game's sudden demand of skill, particularly among the target audience testers as they were not so familiar with the different concepts surrounding linear functions.

### Conclusion

Overal, the results were positive and somewhat along the lines of expectation. Generally, the game was considered enjoyable and many of the target audience testers would use this game to improve their math skills. The mechanics were not so complex that they took away the focus from the math challenges, although the way they were currently implemented felt too steep in some areas due to lack of familiarity. There is a slight lack of challenge in the game-side of things however, though this is largely attributed to the fact this is intended as a proof of concept prototype, rather than a vertical slice of the game.

Issues with the UI were more prevalent. The lack of the control scheme on the screen as suggested in the GDD caused some confusion in areas where the traditional keyboard input was deviated from, such as placing the railtracks with R. Filling in the table on the workbench was also a point of issue as it was unclear in what order the buttons needed to be pressed, or how the table should be filled in. 

Lack of clarity in how to progress is also brought forward as an issue; the tester needed to be guided in order to know what to do and where to do it. Largely this can be attributed to the way the game is presented right now; a barebones prototype with no real introduction or explanation, while a fully fledged game would have more of a gradual introduction to mechanics to help the player understand what is expected of them. Nevertheless, this should remain a point of consideration.

All-in-all, many issues found in the game could be attributed to the state of the game as it is right now; a prototype. 

### Recommendations

- Implement a progression of mechanics, such as a tutorial that gradually introduces the mechanics to the player. A proposed way to do it can be found in [Myth Digger GDD](01%20GDD.md) under the 'Progression' chapter.
- When the overal progression is designed, the increase of challenge needs to be actively considered. This is not only in the aspect of the gameplay; rather, designers should pay close attention to the math questions, the difficulty thereof, and how they are presented as the game continues. A grade setting might be useful - intercepts are not so familiar for students in the first year, but are very familiar concepts for those in later grades. 
- Narrative presentation is rather key in this concept to reflect progress and incentivise the player to continue as they are.
- Adjust the UI to have the controls on screen at all times - this is also added in the GDD for clarity.
- Adjust the UI on the processsing menu to a drag-and-drop of the numbers into the table. 
- Disable placement of rails while jumping, as this completely removes the use of the b-value.

## Concept 3: Mushroom of Bloom

### Context

#### Concept

Mushroom of BLOOM is a kind of tower defence game where the player places towers to defend their kingdom from the enemy, infected mushrooms called Bloomers. The player can place the towers alongside the enemies pathway and aim different types ammunition from towers using linear functions or coordinates. Before each wave the player has the ability to place the towers, upgrade, repair or buy new ones and aim their muzzles in his liking to defend his towers and in extension the kingdom.

#### Hypotheses

We believe that the player will have a good experience with an engaging interaction. They will learn in a playful way how linear functions work. The player will be able to understand the link between how a function looks as a graph and how the formula for this specific function looks like and how they interact.

### Analysis

#### Functionality

- Unintended Behaviour
    > During the playtest, several bugs hindered the gameplay experience. One major issue was that if the tester failed, the game would crash. When placing a new tower, the variables from the old tower placement persisted, causing unintended behaviors. Additionally, if the tester died, the game would crash, further disrupting the experience. Another problem was the flower value, which snapped back to 30 after some rounds. Enemies sometimes didn't attack towers as expected, leading to inconsistent gameplay. Finally, the game was not balanced which making it difficult to achieve a fair and enjoyable experience for the testers.

- Goal Hindrance
    > 75% of the testers were hindred by this bug as they had to restart the whole game if they messed up once

#### Accessibility

- Control Clarity
    > All testers were able to figure out the controls, but sometimes it took a little bit longer. It is not really clear that if you click a button you can place a tower and where you can actually place a tower. Players were unsure about if it was drag or drop. We also observed some unclarity when adjusting the formula / ccoordinates of a shooting / bomb tower. Players thought they could move the line / point or wanted to click a point to set the bomb. Also players immediately touched confirm on the equation setter for the shooting tower.

- Feedback 
    > During 50% of the tests we saw players repeating the same mistake. The most common mistake was not figuring out how to place a tower and when figured out trying again. 

#### User Experience

- Fun
    > 75% of the testers did not want to continue playing the game. Their reasons were: The game needs to be more balanced, the UX made it very frustrating to play and needs to be improved to indicate what you're supposed to do, the mechanics were the issue, not the content and there needs to be more variety in enemy and tower

- Challenge
    > 37.5% of the testers thought the gameplay was challeging enough in its current state. 37.5% of the testers thought that the game is unbalanced but because of that it is challenging. the other 25% of testers thought the game was not challenging because of either bugs or because it was not clear what to do.

- Error prevention and recovery
    > 2 players finished level 1 wave 2 in 1 time. The other testers either did it in more tries or did not finish the wave.

#### Didactic Efficacy

- Learning objectives alignment
    > Every tester could at least tell one mathematicla concept which is in the game. Things we heard were graphs, linear equations, linear algebra, coordinates, formula on graphs, angles, coordinate system and trajectory. All those concepts are displayed in this concept.

- Assessment of knowledge acquisition
    > The results varied when measuring the time of completion. For Level 1, Wave 1, no one could finish within a minute. For Level 1, Wave 2, only a small amount of testers managed to finish within 40 seconds. This can be because they placed most towers somewhere at the middle of the level, causing them to wait for longer then is needed.

- Engagement with educational content
    > Even when given the possibilty, none of the testers wanted to continue the game, as it was still in it's early development and didn't have much variety.
    
- Expression
   > When asked if they would play this game or concept to improve their math abilities, the feedback was mixed. Three testers felt the game seemed far removed from math, noting that you just move a line and could simply type in values instead. Two testers gave a straightforward "no." One tester said "no" because the graphs were not readable. Another tester responded with "sort of," and one tester thought it could work.

#### Game Flow

- Complete concentration on the task
    > Most testers attention was wavering during the time their towers were destroyed and they had to wait for them to lose. Making it quite a punishement when failing a wave. But besides that there their attention was fixated on the game.

- Clarity of goals
    > Most testers it was clear what the goal was. This could presumably be as they've had prior experience with similair tower defence game. This is merely an observation and might not reflect reality.

- Effortlessness and ease
    > In the beginning the testers had difficulty understanding the gameplay, as it was not obvious how the towers worked in the initial wave. Afterwards they had less difficulty as they began to understand the gameplay through trail and error.

- Balance between challenge and skills
    > During gameplay, half of the testers made remarks about the game's difficulty without being promted to. Some players felt the level was too easy, explaining that the bomb tower made it trivial. Others found the game too challenging due to the user experience, which made it hard to understand what was happening. Additionally, the inconsistent movement of enemies, which allowed them to attack towers from a tile away, contributed to the difficulty.

### Conclusion

The user test of Mushroom of BLOOM revealed several key insights into the game's functionality, accessibility, user experience, didactic efficacy, and game flow. The test highlighted significant issues with the game's stability, as frequent crashes and unintended behaviors hindered the gameplay experience. Players encountered persistent bugs, such as variables from old tower placements affecting new ones and enemies not attacking as expected. These issues, combined with a lack of balance, led to a frustrating and inconsistent experience for most testers.

In terms of accessibility, while testers eventually figured out the controls, there was initial confusion about how to place towers and adjust their settings. The feedback mechanisms were insufficient, causing players to repeat the same mistakes without clear guidance on how to proceed. This negatively impacted their overall enjoyment and willingness to continue playing.

From a user experience perspective, a majority of testers found the game unappealing due to its imbalanced difficulty, unclear mechanics, and lack of variety in enemies and towers. Although some players appreciated the challenge, many were discouraged by the game's frustration-inducing elements.

Despite these issues, the game's educational potential was evident. Testers could identify mathematical concepts such as graphs, linear equations, and coordinates within the game. However, the current implementation did not effectively engage players with the educational content, and most testers did not see the game as a viable tool for improving math skills.

Overall, while Mushroom of BLOOM has a promising concept that blends tower defense gameplay with educational content, significant improvements are needed to enhance its stability, clarity, and engagement. Addressing the identified bugs, improving feedback mechanisms, balancing gameplay, and making tower placement more intuitive are crucial steps toward realizing the game's full potential.

### Recommendations

- Resolve bugs where the UI doesn't reflect the actual game state.
- Resolve crashes that happen when the enemy reaches the end of the level and when restarting the level.
- Improve feedback mechanics by adding instant feedback
- Introduce more variety of enemies and towers to promote replayabilty
- Clarify controls of placing towers from the tower UI
- Balance gameplay by reevaluating enemy strength and tower capabilities to ensure a fair challenge.
- Improve the UI for placing towers by making it clear which tower is currently selected and where they can place them by highlighting the area.
