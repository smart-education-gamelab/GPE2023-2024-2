# User Testing: Data Collection & Analysis

This document outlines our approach to collecting and analysing data from user tests.

## Tools

For user testing we will be using the following tools for data collection and analysis:

- `Microsoft Forms`: For collecting the data & performing different types of analyses[^1]
- `Visual Studio Code`: For developing our data models & writing down our findings

## Methodology

### Collection

To make sure our data is collected digitally and can be easily analysed, we will be using `Microsoft Forms`. This means each concept's `User Test Data Model` will be turned into a `Microsoft Form` before the test is performed. To make sure the player isn't bothered by the form, we will have a team member fill it during the user test.

So, to perform the test, there should be at least 2 team members present:

- A `test conductor` to guide the player through the game & test
- An `observer` who will oversee the test and fill in the form

### Analysis

Once the data has been collected, the data will be analysed inside of `Microsoft Forms` using the responses view. 

#### Quantitative

For quantitative data, we will be looking at the numbers and percentages of the responses and interpret them based on the benchmarks defined in the `User Test Plan`.

#### Qualitative

For qualitative data, the methodology will depend on the number of responses:

- `9 or less`: We will be looking at the responses given by the players individually and interpret them to decide on the overall sentiment of the players.
- `10 or more`: We will be using the built-in word clouds to select insightful keywords and phrases to decide on the overall sentiment of the players.
- `20 or more`: We will be using a sentimental analysis tool to decide on the overall sentiment of the players in combination with the word clouds to select insightful keywords and phrases. 

#### Limitations

These methods are highly sensitive to interpretation and are therefore easily influenced by the personal bias of the person interpreting the data. To mitigate this, we will be using a team approach to interpreting the data. This means that at least 2 team members will be interpreting the data and discussing their findings to come to a consensus.

## Justification

The tools and methods we have chosen, are based on the time constraints we have and the need for a digital data collection method. Our qualitative analysis methods are based on the built-in tools provided by `Microsoft Forms`[^2].
