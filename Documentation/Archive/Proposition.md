# Collaboration Proposal

To support our collaboration and make sure everyone is able reach a sufficient grade, we have defined a set of products which need to be produced. These products have been based on the domain description of the HBOi model as provided and used by Alexander & our study course.

We first start by defining the problem description and the HBOi model, after which we define the products we could/should produce per domain.

## Problem Description

Function Dungeon has been in continuous development since it's start-up in 20XX. At the end of 2023 many collaborations have been established with other universities such as; the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and the Satakunta University of Applied Sciences, and including the European Erasmus (project GAMMA). 

As f now the function dungeon is a testing environment, meaning that students play a game and from time to time solve a question to continue playing the game. In order to improve the function dungeon, the client (Erwin van Crasbeek), has reached out to the HvA. the crux of the matter: How can mathematics, and especially linear equations, be incorporated into a fun game? To give ideas and/or examples the client requires six proof of concepts each in the form of a game playable for at least 5-10 minutes.

## HBOi Model

The HBOi model proposes five domains (`User Interaction`, `Organisation Processes`, `Infrastructure`, `Software` & `Hardware Interfacing`) and five activities (`Analyse`, `Advice`, `Design`, `Realise` & `Manage & Control`) in which a developing ICT-person can be categorised. All activities can be divided up into four levels (`Task Oriented`, `Problem Oriented`, `Situation Oriented` & `Profession Oriented`) of professionalism, of which at the end of the HBO-ICT Bachelor, you're expected to have reached at least the third level, `Situation Oriented`.

> For the GPE semester, Alexander informed us students are expected to be in at least the second level, `Problem Oriented`, which should roughly deliver an `up to standard` based on the grading system proposed in the study manual.

If we analyse the model within the context of our project, we came to the conclusion only the domains of `User Interaction` and `Software` are applicable. This is based on the following findings:

- `Organisation Processes`: is mostly focused on, you guessed it, applying ICT on organisational processes, e.g. `How can we improve our communication systems?`, `What do we need to do to get this new technology accepted into the organisation?`, `How are we going to profile and safeguard the strategic goals of the organisation using data?`

- `Infrastructure`: is mostly focused on cloud architecture, enterprise ICT systems management and high performance computing, e.g. `How can we make sure that our standards on security, resilience and performance can be guaranteed?`, `What is the current weak link in our infrastructure?`

- `Hardware Interfacing`: is based on the software domain, but also takes the hardware into high consideration, e.g. `How can we guarantee the software will perform well on this specific system?`, `How can we test our hardware in it's most used environment?`, `How can we design a protocol which allows for reliable production and transmission of high amounts of data?`

### User Interaction

The domain which aligns the best with our project is `User Interaction`. When looking at the field of game development, the activity's as described can be best translated into game design related activities. Most activities are applicable to our project.

## Products

The products described in this chapter are only related to deliverables as expected per domain description for our level and are not related to general project management deliverables (e.g. collaboration agreements, meeting notes, etc.).

### User Interaction

**Product Analysis Report**: This document should outline the analysis of an existing product, in our case Function Dungeon I and others, in relation to  the core values of the client and the user needs.

**Benchmarking Report**: This document should outline which benchmarks are used to test the game, how they are tested and what the results are. Required domains to benchmark are `Functionality`, `Accessibility` and `User Experience`. The other domains should be extracted from the client.

**Research Paper on Interaction Concepts and Techniques**: This foundational document should answer the question of `What are the most applicable game design concepts and techniques within our project context?`. Project context is based on the user needs and core values of the client.

**User Testing Proposal**: This document should outline how user testing is going to be done, what the goals are and what the expected results are. Carla has previous experience with this and can help us guide through this process.

**Technology Requirements Report**: This document should outline the technology requirements for the project, based on the user needs and core values of the client. An example of this is the backend support, input types and graphic technologies.

**Game Design Process Document**: This document should outline the process used to design our game concepts. Which steps are taken, what the goals are and what the expected results are.

**Game Design Documents**: These documents should outline the design of our games and are the first step before an actual prototype is made.

### Software

**Repository Management Document**: This document should outline how we are going to manage our repository.

**Code Conventions Document**: This document should outline the code conventions we are going to use.

**Naming Conventions Document**: This document should outline the naming conventions we are going to use.

**Folder Structure Document**: This document should outline the folder structure we are going to use.

**Requirements Analysis (Update per Concept)**: Per game concept we will have to outline the requirements for the software. `Which functionality do we need to succesfully implement our concept?`

**Software Design Document (Update per Concept)**: This document should outline the design of the software, based on the requirements analysis (e.g. UML, flowchart, etc.).

**Quality Assurance Document**: This document should outline how we are going to safeguard the quality of our software and which quality standards we are going to use.

**Test Design Document (Update per Concept)**: This document should outline how the software is going to be tested (strategy), what the goals are and what the expected results are.

**Proof of Concepts**: Software yay! This is the actual software which is going to be developed for demoing and testing purposes.

### Products & Assessment

These products are a way to prove professionalism/level (e.g. `Unsatisfactory`, `Needs improvement`, `Up to standard`, etc.) and for this first round of products we aimed for an `up to standard`. The actual datapoints for this project are:

- Feedback on the product demo from teachers and students

- Feedback from the other team members to you

- Feedback on architectural design and implementation choices during tech/expert reviews

All feedback is received & processed by the team, after which it is uploaded and ratified by a teacher.

## Planning

### Dependency Analysis

The `product analysis`, `benchmark report`, `research paper on Interaction Concepts and Techniques` and `technology requirements report` are the first products which need to be produced. These products are the foundation for the other products and are needed to make the right choices in the design and development process. They can also be produced in parallel since they are not dependent on each other.

The `user testing proposal` and `game design documents` are the next product which can be produced, since it depends on the previous products.

On the software side, we can work in parallel on the `repository management document`, `code conventions document`, `naming conventions document` and `folder structure document`. Since they don't have a dependency on the other products.

The `requirements analysis` is the next product which can be produced, since it depends on the previous software and user interaction products.

Based on the `requirements analysis`, the `software design document` can be produced. This document is the foundation for the `quality assurance document` and `test design document`.

The `proof of concepts` are the last products which can be produced, since they depend on all previous products.

### Approach

Pretty much the same as the current setup, but without the domain specification. So it comes down to two teams, each with their own lead and a separate project manager working on a chosen product.

#### Roles

- **Lead**: Responsible for the product, tasks, task distribution, and the quality of the product. This person is the go-to person for the team members and the project manager.

- **Project Manager**: Responsible for the planning, documentation and the progress of the products. This person is the go-to person for the product owners (and the team members in case of an emergency).
