# User Test

How do you know that your design is good? Will your design suffice? Does it do all the things that it should do? How would you answer these? Because although you are already designing with the user in mind, how do you know that the design is easy and intuitive to use for your target audience? For you as the designer it will always be easy as cake to navigate through all your designs and you know exactly how and where to find what. In your head it is the cleanest most intuitive design ever made and then you launch it and the the usage of your product goes down. What happened? The responses from the customers let you know that they cannot find what they are looking for, the design is failing. But why? Why are the users so stupid? Your design is perfect! The perfect little snowflake! Was there a way to avoid this? To solve design issues before they become an issue? The answer is called: User Tests!

## Importance

But why do you need to do user tests? The answer is simple: To test the design you are working on based on some simple rules and guidelines. As already stated, a design will always be intuitive for the designer who made it, but the end user is the one who has to work with the solution and they are the one who the design in the end caters for. The designer needs a way to control how usable and intuitive the design is from the perspective of the user. Because in the end, you want a product that the people use. It’s an excellent way to gain valuable insights into what works and what doesn’t. You want to make sure that all assumptions and hypotheses you made are validated, or disproven and improved upon. [^2]

The goal of a user test are [^1]:

1. Identify problems in the design of the product or service
2. Find ways to improve upon your established design
3. Learn about the target users behaviour and patterns

## Process

The most basic user test consists of three components:

1. The Facilitator
2. The Task
3. The Tester

User tests can be done in various different ways, for example looking over someone's shoulder while they interact with the product. The designer taking on the role of a silent observer. Then you can do user tests where you give the tester the product with a very clear task established that they need to complete. While the tester navigates your design he thinks out loud and you as the designer can understand his thinking process, patterns and biases he might have. There are user tests done with only paper as the prototype, wireframes in Figma or full on developed products in combination with tools like an eye tracker.

For this project we will focus on one simple kind of user test: The facilitator gives a task to the tester which the tester then has to complete.

But how do you do that? [^3]

1. First you need to create the design you want to test. It does not matter that it is not polished.
2. Then you need to come up with a test plan. Make sure you develop some kind of "best case solution". Basically the perfect way to complete the task given. Maybe even write it down as a simple user journey. You can expand on that user journey by adding insights into why you think the user would take that route. Document exactly *what* is being tested and how you are going to measure it.
3. Find a suitable location. This point might not feel that important but a lot of aspects can alter how a user interacts with the product. Make sure that it somewhat resembles the environment that your target user is going to use the product. To come back to the tax example, you won't be doing your taxes on a bench next to the football field.
4. Recruit testers. You need people to test the prototype with, obviously. Keep in mind that you recruit testers that fit into your target audience. It does not matter what a child thinks of a design when it is aimed for adults to help them doing their taxes!
5. Conduct the test. You as the designer need to conduct the test and make sure that the tester understands exactly what he needs to to. Don't show him the solution to your tasks that you give him but explain the tasks clear to them. Maybe even have them written down somewhere so when the tester forgets what he needs to do, he can easily get back on track. Explain to the user that this test is not to test him as the tester, but to test the design. Tell him there is nothing that he can do wrong in this scenario! Every type of feedback is valuable. Tell the tester that he should think out loud every step of the way. Every thought he thinks and every decision he is making. Because you as the designer need to understand his thinking patterns to improve upon your design.
   - first thing he should explain what he sees
   - before he does something he should explain why he wants to do the action
   - before he clicks on a button he should explain what he will expect from this action
     Make sure that the user keeps this up as he goes through the tasks. If he forgets, or his answers get scarce, remind him of speaking his thoughts out loud or ask him specific questions. And, this is something that I always need to remind myself of; the critique on the design does not mean that you did shitty work or you are a bad designer. This is a critique on the product and every constructive feedback and criticism is welcome and needed to improve upon the design.
6. Write down notes. Do this *while* conducting the user test, write down everything that you notice and keep note of the thought process of the tester. If you are too overwhelmed by conducting the test, ask a friend to keep the notes for you.
7. Document the test results. After the user test, look back on your notes, go through them one more time, order and document them neatly. After that you can make tasks based on the test results to improve upon your design. Or not, if the test was completed successfully.
8. Analyze the test results. All words in the word cloud will be analysed (i.e. are any words missing, does it align with expectations etc.)[^4].

## Results

The results of the user tests are an important basis to improve upon your design. Make sure that you write down everything and document your takeaway so that other designers can understand the way you went about to improve the design. Have all the tests together so that you can also compare the different tests to each other. If only 1 out of 10 has one particular problem, the problem is not as important as a problem every participant faced, and should therefore be less prioritized in solving. The test results might be hurting to you as the designer, I always have to remind myself that this is not a personal critique. And if a tester cannot find the button even if you think that the button is screaming at their face, remember to stay calm and note that the button needs a redesign instead of writing down: The stupid client cannot even see the button IF IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE! Not that I ever did something like that...

And remember: test test test! After the first round of tests, test your redesign as well if you have time so that your design can become the perfect little snowflake that you see in it!
