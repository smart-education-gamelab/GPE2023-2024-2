# User Test Analysis

## Benchmarks

Below all benchmarks for each subject have been written down.
They've been seperated by quantitative and qualitative questions.
Later on in the document (during the test phase) it will be described in more detail as to how and when these benchmarks should be kept in mind.

### Accessibility

*Quantitative*

- Control Clarity:

  - How many seconds does it take the player to figure out the control scheme?

- UI clarity and simplicity:

  - How many clicks does the player require to open/start the level?
  - How many times does the player ask the test supervisor how the UI works?

### User Experience

*Quantitative*

- Fun:
  - Did the player ask to continue the game?

*Qualitative*

- Fun:

  - Would you continue play? And if we made more content?
- Sense of urgency:

  - Why did you (not) feel time pressure to finish the level?
- Satisfaction:

  - How do you feel after completing the level? Do you feel satisfied?
  - Why?
- Challenge:

  - Why do you think the gameplay is (not) challenging?

### Educational Progress

*Quantitative*

- Assessment of knowledge acquisition:

  - Are the players able to finish each level within a set amount of time?
  
- Tutorial and guidance options:

  - Can the player hit an enemy within their first 2 tries?

*Qualitative*

- Learning objectives alignment:

  - Do you know what mathematical concepts were in the game?
- Expression:

  - Would you play this game to improve your math abilities?

### Game Flow

*Quantitative*

- Complete concentration on the task:

  - How many times would the players let themselves be interrupted / distracted?
- Clarity of goals and reward in mind and immediate feedback:

  - How many times did the players ask questions?
- Effortlessness and ease:

  - Are the players able to complete each level within a set amount of time?
    - level 1: ~~1 minute 30 seconds~~
    - level 2: ~~2 minutes~~
    - (demo) level 3: ~~2 minutes 30 seconds~~
- Balance between challenge and skills:

  - Did the player make a remark about the difficulty of the game (i.e. too easy/difficult)?

*Qualitative*

- Balance between challenge and skills:
  - Did you feel like the game was doable with your skillset (math knowledge)?
