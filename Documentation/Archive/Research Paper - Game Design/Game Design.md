## Literature Review

The purpouse of this Literature Review is to conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature on game design. Discuss key theories, concepts, and methodologies used in game design research. Analyze previous studies and identify gaps in the current knowledge.

Conducting a comprehensive review of the existing literature on game design involves exploring several key areas: foundational theories, predominant concepts, methodologies used in research, and an analysis of the gaps in current knowledge. By delving deeper into whats already been researched we have tools to base this research on.

### Key Theories in Game Design

1. **Ludology vs. Narratology**: This debate revolves around whether games should primarily focus on gameplay mechanics (ludology) or narrative elements (narratology). Ludologists argue that games are fundamentally different from stories and should be studied for their rule-based systems, while narratologists believe that narrative is equally important in creating an engaging experience. [7]

2. **Flow Theory**: Csikszentmihalyi's Flow Theory is often applied to game design to ensure that games keep players in a state of flow, where they are fully immersed and engaged with the right level of challenge.[8]

3. **Game Mechanics and Dynamics (MDA)**: These theories explore how game rules (mechanics) interact to produce gameplay (dynamics) and the resultant emotional and behavioral responses in players (aesthetics).[9]

### Key Concepts in Game Design

1. **User Experience (UX)**: This concept focuses on understanding and designing for the emotional, cognitive, and social experiences of players. UX research aims to optimize enjoyment and engagement through user-centered design.[10]

2. **Gamification**: The use of game elements in non-game contexts to motivate and enhance user experience and engagement. Studies often investigate its effectiveness across various domains such as education, health, and business.[11]

3. **Serious Games and Edutainment**: Games designed for purposes other than mere entertainment, such as education, training, or health improvement. Research often focuses on their effectiveness and how they can be improved.[12]

### Methodologies Used in Game Design Research

1. **Empirical Studies**: Methods that focus on quantity. Surveys and experiments are common in such studies, aiming to gather data on player behavior and preferences. [13]

2. **Qualitative Research**: Includes ethnography (ethnic/cultural research), interviews, and content analysis to understand deeper, subjective experiences of players.[14]

3. **Design-based Research (DBR)**: This iterative approach involves researchers and designers in the real-world setting to refine game designs based on user feedback.[15]

### Gaps in Current Knowledge

1. **Diversity and Inclusivity**: More research is needed on how games can be designed to be inclusive of diverse populations in terms of gender, age, culture, and (dis)ability.

2. **Long-term Effects**: There is a lack of studies on the long-term impacts of game playing, particularly in the context of serious games and gamification.

3. **Cross-Disciplinary Integration**: While game design benefits from insights from psychology, narrative theory, and technology, there is still a gap in fully integrating these disciplines to create a holistic game design methodology.

4. **Impact Measurement of Gamification**: Although widely used, the long-term impact and effectiveness of gamification need more rigorous investigation.

### Concluding Remarks

The studies on game design is vast and interdisciplinary, covering a range of theories from the psychological aspects of gameplay to practical design techniques. However there remain numerous opportunities for deeper investigation. Like Function dungeon where game design is adapted to broader societal needs. The future of game design research likely lies in these unexplored areas, offering a rich avenue for new studies and methodologies.

## Methodology

To describe the methodology used in research, we need to consider several fundamental aspects: research design, data collection methods, and analysis techniques.

### Research Design

The research design is the framework (or blueprint) for conducting the study. It guides the selection of data collection and analysis methods. In the context of game design, an experimental design might be used to rigorously/ thoroughly assess the impact of different game features on player engagement. This design allows researchers to manipulate variables (such as game mechanics) and observe the outcomes (such as player satisfaction or learning outcomes).

Alternatively, a **mixed-methods** approach could combine quantitative methods (like surveys or telemetry data in form of dashboards) with qualitative methods (like interviews or participant observation) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of player experiences. This approach is particularly useful in understanding not just how but why certain game features affect players.

### Data Collection Methods

#### Quantitative data

might be collected through structured surveys, questionnaires, or analytics tools that gather data on user interactions within the game. This approach is beneficial for obtaining data from a large number of participants, which is excellent for statistical analysis and generalization of findings.

#### Qualitative data

could be gathered through methods such as semi-structured interviews, focus groups, or ethnographic observation. These methods are suited to exploring deeper insights into the players' thoughts and feelings about the game, providing context to the quantitative data.

In game design research, combining both types of data collection can provide a robust understanding of how game elements influence player behavior and satisfaction.

### Analysis Techniques

#### Quantitative analysis

Might include statistical tests, regression analysis, or machine learning techniques (like ChatGPT) to identify patterns or effects within the data we as human can't see. For example, regression analysis could be used to determine the strength and nature of the relationship between game complexity and player engagement.

#### Qualitative analysis

Often involves coding textual responses to identify themes or patterns. Methods such as thematic analysis or discourse analysis can be applied to interview transcripts or focus group discussions to extract meaningful insights about player experiences and preferences.

### Justification and Limitations

The chosen mixed-methods approach is justified as it leverages the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative research. Quantitative methods allow for broad generalization and statistical validation of trends observed in player behavior, while qualitative methods provide depth and context, capturing the nuances of player experiences that quantitative methods might overlook.

However, this approach has limitations:

- Time and resource-intensive: Conducting both quantitative and qualitative research requires significant resources and time, which can be challenging.
- Complexity in integration: Synthesizing findings from both types of data can be complex and may lead to difficulties in interpretation if the data contradict each other.
- Sampling issues: Recruiting a representative sample for both quantitative and qualitative components can be challenging, potentially affecting the generalizability and validity of the research.
