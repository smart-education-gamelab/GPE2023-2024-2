<!--### Lens of Essential Experience

**What experience do I want the player to have**

The game is aimed to teach children linear functions. So the experience is centered around that concept. By walking through the rooms and solving different linear problems the player can progress through the dungeon. The player should learn the math to solve the linear functions through a playful experience without any time pressure.

**What is essential to the experience**

Essential to that experience is the ability to play and interact with linear functions in a playful way to that the children get a good understanding of how the math works.
In the function Dungeon, the player already needs understand of how linear functions work because the game at the moment does not set a focus on teaching the player. It feels more like a disguised test. You get math problems while walking through the dungeon and interacting with different items. It is essential that the player has an "Aha"-moment of some kind, but the game is set up so that the player is just tested on their knowledge instead of actually teaching them *how* linear functions work. If they get an answer wrong they are thrown in a room with a book in which the solution to the problem is written with sometimes a paragraph of explanation. What I found while playing the game is that I just click on the answer the game tells me is correct and make a mental note so the next time I get the same problem I know which answer was correct, instead of truly understanding why I was wrong. 

**How can the game capture that essence?**

The game in this state fails at capturing this experience because it plays like a math test, disguised as a dungeon crawler. The game should shift the focus more on having a fun approach to teach the children linear functions instead of just throwing math problems at them. They could incorporate more interactive problems than just simple multiple choice questions.

### Lense of Fun
**What parts of the game are fun?**

Exploring the dungeon. Finding out where the dungeon leads and what the goal of the game is. The question that kept me going was: is there an end to the dungeon? Is there an exit I can get to?
Other than that, I got fed up with the game fairly quickly because of the nature of the game feeling more like a test. It annoyed me that every time I failed a question, I was thrown into a room with a book that just gave me the answer instead of teaching me how to approach and solve the math problem.

**What parts need to be more fun?**

The core gameplay loops lacks in fun and excitement. You go from room to room and solve math problems instead of learning the math, you are expected to know the solution. This type of gameplay gets old really fast. You get thrown into the solution room where you get told what the solution is with sometimes a explanation to why but I caught myself not looking at the explanation at all and just wanting to continue.

### Lense of Flow
**Does the game have clear goals?**

The Function Dungeon does not establish any goals. You get thrown into the dungeon with only knowledge about how to move and interact with different items. Only one of the items in each room is an interactable (except for the NPCs) but it is not clear every time which item that is. Sometimes it is a book on the table, sometimes it is a pillar. Some of the items have a sparkle to them so you know which one you can interact with. It is up to the teacher of the children to explain the usage and the goals of the game.

**Are the goals of the player the same goals the developer intended?**

The goal of the Function Dungeon, as the developers intended them to be, is to learn linear functions in a setting that allows the player to learn the math in their own pace with no time pressure. It is true that there is no time pressure for the player to solve the problems, but there is also the component that the player gets annoyed because he cannot progress further if he cannot solve the problem. Because the player is thrown into the experience their goal is to progress through the function dungeon and see how far they can progress and what the dungeon holds for them. The math questions present themselves more of an obstacle instead of furthering their knowledge of linear functions.

**Do parts of the game distract players so they forget their goal**

Because there is no clearly established goal, the player cannot really forget it either. There is nothing to do for the player aside from walking through the dungeon and interacting with objects, so the chance of them forgetting their goal is small, the chance that they get bored or annoyed at the gameplay is greater. 

**Does the game provide a steady stream of gradually increasing challenges?**

The questions given to the player are chosen randomly from a series of math problems. So, there is no linear progression in difficulty, because one time you might get an easy question followed by an exceptionally hard one. The challenge does not increase consistently but increases and decreases randomly.  

**Are the player's skill improving as expected?**

The player's skill might improve, but not as expected. Because the nature of the function dungeon, to just show questions rather than letting the player experience how linear functions work by themselves, the player's skill of remembering what question was right instead of which understanding the math problem will increase.

### Lense of Skill
**What skills does the game require from the player?**

Because the function dungeon plays like a test, the player already must have a solid understanding of how linear functions work. The player has to understand what a linear function is, how it looks like, has to know how the slope works, what each variable in the formula `y = ax + b` means and how they interact with one another. In conclusion the player needs to fulfill all the Learning Goals defined by the developers pre playing the game, although the game is meant to teach those learning goals to them.

**Are there categories of skill that this game is missing?**

The game does have questions that are easier than others, but even these ones require a basic understanding of linear functions which are not taught by the game itself. The game offers a variety of different questions in varying difficulties so for players well versed in linear functions the skill level matches.

**Which skills are dominant?**

For successfully playing the function dungeon, the player has to have a high knowledge of math and linear functions and therefore requires a high skill level. The skills required to play the function dungeon are all the learning goals defined by the developers.

**Are these skills creating the intended experience?**

The skills required are too high for first-time players with zero knowledge of linear functions. The game does not progressively get harder but gives the player random questions which vary greatly in skill level. So, for first time players the game will be a frustrating experience because they won't be able to get through the dungeon without understanding what is going on and what is required of them.

**Are some players much better at these skills than others?**

Yes some players, for example players in higher age groups with more experience in math and linear functions, will have an easier time playing the function dungeon as their skill level matches the question asked by the game.

**Does this make the game feel unfair?**

Due to this circumstance the game will feel unfair to first time players, although they might not initially feel like it’s unfair and have more of a feeling of helplessness and frustration.

**Can players improve their skills with practice?**

Players who take the game seriously and will take their time to answer every question and look at the solution and help given to them until they understand will see a progression in their level. But as we all know, humans are lazy and like to take the path of least resistance, especially if that path always looks the same. They will start to just remember the correct answer to a specific question instead of trying to understand and learn how to solve the problem.

**Does this game demand the right level of skill?**

The game demands a high level of skill which the target audience will not meet. At least not the audience aged 12 for which this game is designed to be the first introduction to linear functions. For players which already have a good understanding of math and linear functions the skill level required to play function dungeon will suffice.

### Lense of Challenge
**What are the challenges in the game?**

The challenges in the game present themselves as being math questions the players have to answer to complete the puzzle and open the door to the next dungeon room.

**Are they too easy, too hard or just right?**

The questions range from easy, intermediate, advanced and hard. The problem presented is that, by design, the function dungeon chooses a random question out of an array with varying levels of difficulty. So, the player might get a hard question, that succeeds their level of knowledge followed by a question which is too easy for them. There is no steady progression in challenge.

**Can the challenges accommodate a wide variety of skill levels?**

The questions incorporated into the function dungeon do accommodate a wide variety of skill levels.

**How does the level of challenge increase as the player succeeds?**

The level of challenge changes randomly from question to question, so there is no guarantee that the player has a gradual progression of the level of challenge throughout the game.

**Is there enough variety in the challenges?**

The questions offer a great deal of diversity, ranging from easy to hard questions regarding the difficulty and the type of question. The types of question range from choosing the correct illustration to a given function, to having to solve for a particular slot in a table of values and more.

**What is the maximum level of challenges in the game?**

The hardest question I encountered while playing the game was a question about an illustration showing dots and how many dots will be displayed in a different generation. For me this was hard, because at the moment I was caught off guard because I expected a question more concrete about linear functions. 

### Lense of Accessibility
**How will the players know how to begin playing the game? Does it need explaining or is it self-evident?**

The function dungeon has the controls displayed on the starting screen of the game, explaining the movement and how to interact with different elements like puzzles or NPCs. What the goal of the game is or what to expect is not explained. Although because this game is made to complement the teaching material in school and open another dimension of learning for the students, the job of explaining what this game is about and what the goals are falls to the teachers.

**Does the game act like something they have seen before? If yes, how can attention be drawn to that fact and if not, how can the understanding of the behavior be made clear**

Because there are not that many games that teach math or more specifically linear functions, there are no comparable titles that work in a similar way. Although the concept of solving a puzzle to progress into another room in a dungeon is nothing new. The math questions themselves should be familiar and the concept of testing their knowledge as well.

**Does the game draw people in and make them want to touch it and manipulate it? If not, what changes need to be done so that it does?**

The game’s core gameplay loop relies on the player interacting with elements to solve puzzles, therefore manipulation and interaction is key. Although the visual cues to help the player know with what he can interact are sometimes lacking and the player has to find out for themselves with which element he can interact.-->
