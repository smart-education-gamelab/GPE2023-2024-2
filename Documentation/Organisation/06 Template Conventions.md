# Template Conventions

This document outlines the conventions used in the templates for the project. The conventions are designed to ensure consistency across the project and to make it easier to navigate the project documentation.

## Naming Conventions

### Template Naming

For the templates, we use the following naming convention:

`[Product] Template`

Where `[Product]` is the name of the product the template is for. For example, the template for the `User Test Plan` is named `User Test Plan Template`.

### Title Naming

When it comes to titles within the templates, we use the following naming conventions:

`[Concept]: [Product]`

Where `[Concept]` is the concept the product is based on and `[Product]` is the name of the product. For example, the title for the `User Test Plan` for the `Angry Equations` game is `Angry Equations: User Test Plan`.

## Versioning

To make sure that everyone is working with the same version of the templates, we use version numbers. The version number is placed at the top of the document and derivatives, right under the title. The version number follows the following format:

`vX.Y`

Where `X` is the major version number and `Y` is the minor version number. The major version number is increased when there are significant changes to the template, and the minor version number is increased for minor spelling or formatting changes.
