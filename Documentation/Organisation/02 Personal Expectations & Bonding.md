# Personal Expectations & Bonding

This document is to reinforce our collaboration as it outlines what we expect from each other, what we want to achieve personally and our approach to team bonding.

## Personal Motivation & Goals

The motivation and goal(s) of each team member are important to understand. This will help the team to work together more effectively and to support each other in achieving their goals. The following table shows the number of hours everyone is able to work on the project, their personal goals, their grade expectations and notes on extra needs or circumstances.
