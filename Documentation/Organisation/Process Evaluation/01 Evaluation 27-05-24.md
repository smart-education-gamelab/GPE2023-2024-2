# Process Evaluation 27-05-24

## Design

*GDD*

- Missing a start condition from progression -> Take it up in the GDD template with a comment

*DED*

- Pick a few lenses we are always going to use
  - Is there a lens which is inherent to the math serieus game? -> “scale” & “flow”-> Take it up in the DED template

*MISC*

- Currently problems with tracking progression -> Michael & Willem will try to take this up better next time
- Surprised about the implementation missing from GDD-3

## Code

- Currently there are no remarks on the process 
- Next Code & Architecture Review will be on 05-06-24
