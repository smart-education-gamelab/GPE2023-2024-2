 In the table above we identified the role of the people involved with our project.

## Categories

To get a better idea of how everyone is involved we setup the following table:

|           | Primary                                                 | Secondary                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Internal  | Team Members, Project Managers, Team Leads              | Project Coach                                  |
| External  | Client, Math Curriculum Advisor, Math Didactics Advisor | Target Audience, Design Coach, Technical Coach |
| Interface | Hogeschool van Amsterdam, Family                        | University of Twente, de Wageningse Methode    |

---

`Primary`: has direct impact on the approach or result of the project.

`Secondary`: has an indirect impact on the approach or result of the project.

---

`Internal`: is involved with the project from within the team.

`External`: is involved with the project from outside the team.

`Interface`: not involved with the project, but has a legitimate stake in it.

---

## Stakeholder Interest

To get a better idea what the influence and stake is of everyone involved, we setup the following table:

---

**Horizontal axis**: the importance of the interest of the stakeholder

**Vertical axis**: influence/power of the stakeholder

|           | Low                                                                                      | Medium                    | High                | Very High               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Low       | *Hogeschool van Amsterdam, University of Twente, de Wageningse Methode, Target Audience* |                           |                     |                         |
| Medium    | *Family, Math Didactics Advisor, Technical Coach*                                        | *Math Curriculum Advisor* |                     | Client                  |
| High      | <mark>Design Coach</mark>                                                                |                           | <u>Team Members</u> |                         |
| Very High | <mark>Project Coach</mark>                                                               |                           | <u>Team Leads</u>   | <u>Project Managers</u> |

<mark>Influencer</mark>: needs to be kept satisfied.

> Stakeholders with a lot of influence, but little interest in the project, known as influencers, can cause significant damage if they turn against the project. You prevent this type of stakeholders from using their power and influence against the project by keeping them satisfied.

<u>Key figure</u>: needs to be pampered.

> Stakeholders with both a lot of power and influence and significant interests in the project are the most important category. These key figures can make or break a project. Key figures should be closely monitored and pampered.

*Observer*: needs to be monitored.

> Stakeholders with little influence and power and who also have little interest in the project can be seen as spectators. You should keep an eye on them (monitor), but beyond that, you don’t need to pay much attention to this type of stakeholder.

Interested Party: needs to be informed.

> Stakeholders with little influence and power, but who have significant interests in the project, should be provided with the right information. You keep this group of interested parties satisfied by informing them well about how their interests are considered in the project.

## Relations

Using the information from the previous tables, we can now create a stakeholder relations diagram. This diagram shows the relationship between the stakeholders and the project.

---

`- - -`: this line represents an actual relationship. 

`. . .`: this line indicates a potential relationship.
