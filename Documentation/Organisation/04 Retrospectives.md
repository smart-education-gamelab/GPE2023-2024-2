# Retrospectives

This document contains the retrospectives of the project. The retrospectives are held after every product demo event and are used to reflect on the project process and team dynamics.

## Format

Per retrospective, the following format is used:

- `Reflection`: A brief reflection on the previous action points that were set and if they were achieved or not.
- `Action Points`: The action points that were set during the retrospective.

During retrospectives we need to look at the following aspects:

- `Ambition`: Are we growing as a team?
- `Reflection`: Are we getting better at collaborating?
- `Accountability`: Do we know how everyone is doing?
- `Courage`: Are we able to speak up and give feedback?
- `Collaboration`: Do we all have team-centred tasks?

## Retrospective I
