# Code & Product Quality

This document outlines how we ensure product quality and how we maintain it throughout the development process.

## Code Quality

To ensure code quality, we have implemented the following practices:

- `Pull Request Reviews`: All code changes are reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged into the main branch.
- `Code & Architecture Reviews`: We conduct regular code and architecture reviews to ensure that our code base is maintainable and scalable.
- `Linting`: We use an `.editorconfig` to enforce consistent coding styles and formatting across IDEs and editors.

By following these practices, we ensure that our code is of high quality and is easy to maintain.

## Product Quality

Since product quality is not a key focus area for this project, we have implemented the following practices to ensure that the product meets the minimum quality standards:

- `User Testing`: We conduct regular user testing sessions to gather feedback on the product.
- `Bug Tracking`: We use a bug tracking system to keep track of all reported issues and prioritize them based on severity.

For our bug tracking system, we use the following template:

```markdown
# Bug: [Title]

## Expected Behaviour

Describe what you expected to happen.

## Actual Behaviour

Describe what actually happened.

## Steps to Reproduce

List the steps required to reproduce the issue.

## Additional Information

Any additional information that may be relevant.
