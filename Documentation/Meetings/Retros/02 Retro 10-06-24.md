# Retro 10-06-24

## Retro Debriefing

- Please make the board better readable
- Teams visual board of the pictures/documentation of the retro
- In general the teachers are happy with the team
- Most action points are good
- Please think about your collaboration in your self-reflection
- Chantal & Carla had the best retro forms
- Collaborative is on-point, individual is lacking
- Most feedback forms did not have any actual action points, missing them individually
- Please don’t burn out with the heavy requirements that have been setup

## Winand's Personal notes

- Kian went down since it is circular… -> Why does it keep happening? What is the problem core?
- Flying so high, look somewhere else for feedback (Kian & Winand) -> look at industry, idols, set goals for reflection
- Michael has very concrete action points for a good reflection
- Tigo missed any action points and reflections on the feedback
- Winand needs to be more fleshed out, be more concrete about actions

## Feedback on Grading

- Currently missing the link between the forms and the peer evaluation board since there is a lot of focus on the feedback forms over the team session

## Personal Reflection: What Happend (Causation)

- Make it very personal -> zoom in on how you improved yourself in regards to the collaboration and adding to the process -> so not the moved work (content), but behaviour and personal growth
