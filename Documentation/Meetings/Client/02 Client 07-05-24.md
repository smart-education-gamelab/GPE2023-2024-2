## Meeting notes

- Not opposed to the idea of a minigame-like larger game concept, but this takes away the initial challenge of incorporating all learning goals within one concept
- Wants to continue with 6 separate concepts to be detailed, but if at the end we can find a method of tying it all together, would be open to hearing this
- Pointed out time constraints, focus on rapid prototyping after first sprint
- Generally very positive about our workflow so far, though!
- Inquired about the idea of authorability; teachers being able to modify or build their own levels
- Said that this is a key element of the larger European project and thus is desired
- If our concept can incorporate authorability and can be actively used for other sorts of subjects to be taught, this is **highly** valuable for the larger project as a whole
- However we should not be limited by this as our current level of prototyping and concepting is not advanced enough
- But kept in mind
