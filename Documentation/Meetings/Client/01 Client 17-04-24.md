## Agenda

- Introduce the group

- Ask for previous documentation

- Pry for a creative direction

- Discuss the limits of the project
  
  - Which types of functions are expected?
  
  - Make agreements on the amount of concepts

- Schedule future meetings

## Meeting Notes

- Its a research project, rapid prototyping

- European project focused on educational research, evolution, etc.

- The paper is the foundation of the project

- Currently not immersive at all, math shows up and breaks gameplay

- Gradual increase in difficulty

- We are going to work on something new, not to continue on the old project

- Erwin has done the Applied Artificial Intelligence master, has applied AI into the game with level generation and difficulty generation

- Other people (teachers, researchers, etc.) should be able to add their own content, aka user generated content 

- Erwin wants arounds 6 to 10 concepts

- Most important is gradual difficulty and math integration into the core game design

- GAMMA project is the base foundation

- The learning goals mention the questions

- The technical scope: art extreme low priority, focus on the game design, think out of the box solutions 

- Singleplayer focus, multiplayer optional

- Time per game sessions: function dungeon 30 min to an hour, for us we can also have shorter more varied sessions

- Don'ts: age group is 12 to 18, keep that in mind

- Testing is going to be difficult, but can be looked into

- What does it mean to incorporate all the learning goals: understand the maths behind the game and the didactics of learning maths

- Allow space for the didactics to be applied, the journey of learning is important

- P.o.C., conversing the concept is more important than a final polished product

- Our product is a stepping stone for their goals, it is to prove a game can be made to learn math

- The products to be concepted are serious games

- M.V.P. over P.o.C., or differently put, sell the experience, even if it doesn't work in the backend

- Next week: design clinic with Karel, prepare a problem and present it to get advise from all other designers

## Action Points

- Erwin: will give us an export of the learning goals with the questions

- Discuss how we want to weave erwin into our development process

- Discuss the project goal: concepting to prove gamification can be applied to math learning, rooted in game design knowledge

- Develop a strategy to approach the problem of project size, are we gonna ask for lesser concepts, if so how (develop some upfront, ask directly, etc)

- Get a math teacher, probably Anke Roberts

- Find games which apply math in the learning

- Refresh high school math knowledge
