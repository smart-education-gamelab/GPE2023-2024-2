# Code 25-04-24

## Agenda

- Discuss ~~code design &~~ implementation process
- ~~Convert the requirements analysis into tasks~~
  - ~~Define acceptance criteria per task~~

## Meeting Notes

We discussed the first plan and tried it out, didn't work well.

---

- Height slider user story is missing 
- The first two stories of epic one are doubled
- User story for buttons is worded incorrectly, replace with “As a student I want to have a top and bottom button to change the slope of the projectile, so that I can can see the effect of the slope on it's trajectory.”
- First user story of epic 3 misses the word “able”
- Height button user story is missing
- When defining height, it should be clarified it is about starting height

## Action Points

- Winand: draw up a more lean process & create new project progression board

- Dylan, Kian & Tigo: start with first naive implementation
