# Code 19-04-24

## Agenda

- Discuss code architecture workflow
  
  - Which core values are we going to embody?
  
  - How are we going to pre-design systems/features before implementation?
  
  - How do we want to structure our Kanban tickets (create yaml templates)?

- Discuss code conventions

- Discuss code naming conventions

- Discuss repository management
  
  - Are we going to use protected branches in combination with pull requests (to fork or not to fork)?
  
  - Are we going to use feature branching, or are we going to use a rolling release model?

- Translate the first concept into applicable tasks

## Meeting Notes

- Discuss code architecture workflow
  
  - Which core values are we going to embody?
    
    "Keep it simple, stupid and editor first"
  
  - How are we going to pre-design systems/features before implementation?
    
    **Frequency of architectural design meetings:** immediately after a design proposal.
    
    **Frequency of architectural review meetings:** every monday
    
    **Tools:** draw.io with UML
    
    **Documentation:** all decisions & designs will be uploaded to the documentation git repo
    
    Use review meetings to keep UML diagrams updated.
  
  - How do we want to structure our Kanban tickets (create yaml templates)?
    
    ```textile
    - Description
    - UML picture
    - Size
    - Dependencies
    - Acceptance Criteria 
    - Definition of Done
    ```

- Discuss code conventions
  
  Code conventions: [C# Coding Conventions - C# | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)

- Discuss code naming conventions
  
  Naming conventions: [C# identifier names - rules and conventions - C# | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names)

- Discuss repository management
  
  - Are we going to use protected branches in combination with pull requests (to fork or not to fork)?
    
    We're going to work with forking and pull requests using protected branches.
  
  - Are we going to use feature branching, or are we going to use a rolling release model?
    
    The rolling release model with only a main branch is going to be used.

- ~~Translate the first concept into applicable tasks~~

## Action Points

- Monday 22, Coding Team: will prepare themselves for designing the UML and writing the tickets
