- demo will be done by the coding team? will come down to the product demo
- rest will be done by the design team? Does it really matter? because it's the product of the entire group
- we should not talk anymore about the process Karel said, we need to talk about what is our goal, where do we wanna go.
- Can we still flex a little bit? 
- prerecord the product demo, so everything goes smoothly and the teachers have nothing to pin point and talk shit about.
- a code person still needs to talk during the video!
- product demo on week 10 for the client, give them the option if they want to do it either on tuesday, wednesday or friday.
