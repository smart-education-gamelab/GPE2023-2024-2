**Meta Analysis** got made to take the evaluation documents and analyse them

- Take those evalusation, quatify them and show the results in a visual way
  
  - Radar chart or heatmap
- This gets applied in literary reviews where multiple papers get analized on certain criteria
  
- There is a worry about time but we got reassured that it is very copy pasteble and doesnt have to be a whole research paper
